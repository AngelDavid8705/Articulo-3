1,Haunted Places,"When I was 8 years old my Mom and Dad purchased a home located in Burlingame, California. They got a great deal on the house and were thrilled at its location, and the town. I recall the first time I entered the house I said to my Mom ""It is so dark in here."" My Mother reassured me that with a little paint and new drapes it would be bright and sunny. I think that the darkness I noticed wasn't just because of the dark walls and drapes, there was something much darker hidden in the seams of the house. This darkness didn't stay hidden for long. Before we moved our belongings into the home my Dad, and one of his friends, Dick, went to the house to refinish the hardwood floors. They were in for a challenging set of experiences. When they turned on the sander the radio would blast, when they turned off the radio the light would go on. Then the electricity would shut off. They checked the fuses, but none of them were burned out. My Dad called the power company, the man who came out said there was nothing wrong with the connection from the power pole to the house. He told my Dad that he needed to call an electrician. The electrician witnessed the strange and inexplicable relation between unrelated switches and the response from remote locations throughout the house. The electrician told my Dad that the entire house needed to be rewired. To their surprise after this announcement all the electrical appliances and lights worked as expected. All returned to normal operation at that time. This stunt repeated many times over the years. We just had to wait it out because there was nothing wrong with the fuses, fuse box, the connection to the power pole. There was no technical explanation. I will say that being in a totally dark house due to the actions of invisible intruders was quite terrifying. We were at their mercy, and they had little to no mercy. After we moved into the house we immediately noted that at times it sounded as if someone was walking across the floor, or there would be what sounded like knocking on various doors throughout the house. The back door would open and slam closed, which would be followed by what sounded like footsteps coming up the stairs. My parents explained to me that these sounds were the sounds of the house settling. Often when I went to bed at night I would hear heavy breathing right by my face. My parents told me this was what the water heater sounded like at night when it was heating the water. I would hear my Mother call, and when I answered she would say she did not call me, and visa versa. I often found long auburn hairs in my bedroom. I couldn't figure this out. I didn't know anyone with auburn hair. My parents became acquainted with the next door neighbors. They commented to Mom and Dad that they hoped that they lived there longer than other people that had moved in. The house had always been sold, never rented, but it was rare for any family to live there more than 3 months. The neighbors had lived next door for over 20 years. There were times when I woke up with someone holding on to my ankles and pulling me off the end of the bed. This terrified me. When I told my parents they assured me that I was only having a nightmare. I woke up in the mornings to find pieces clipped from my hair. This left short jagged pieces I couldn't style. My Mom told me this was from the pin curls I used. One afternoon I was in my bedroom and couldn't shake the feeling that someone was staring at me. This gave me the creeps, so I decided to go out to the living room. In that I felt so uneasy, I stepped down on the first step in front of the door and reached around the corner to turn off the light. When I turned off the light I saw a young woman sitting on the bed right next to where I had been sitting. She had long auburn hair. She was transparent. I didn't believe in ghosts. My parents had told me over and over again there was no such thing. Now I was faced with the terrifying reality of a ghost sitting on my bed. I ran to the front bathroom, slammed and locked the door. Then it dawned on me that if she was a ghost and what they say about ghosts was true she could walk through the wall and I would be locked inside with her. I unlocked the door and ran to the living room in the front of the house. In the morning I told my parents about my experience. They exchanged glances and then they told me that they knew that the house was haunted. The ghost I described to them is the one they called ""Florence."" It took them about 3 years to believe the house was haunted. They didn't believe it until they had exhausted themselves by sneaking through the house trying to find the intruders making all the noises, and never finding anything. Then one night when they had just gotten into bed, turned off the lights, and above the end of their bed were two floating heads staring at them. They both saw these apparitions, and could not deny what they saw. This put them on a trek of using an Ouija board to try to communicate with the ghosts. Knowing what I do now about the response to this board by earth bound spirits I am certain this practice only made things worse. There were many ghosts. I only saw two fully manifest apparitions, but my parents saw and experienced many more. I saw ""things"" but only 2 specific ones. It was a common experience to see items, such as books, fly across the room. One time my Mom was taking a nap on the couch in the living room. The couch seemed to be shaking. She opened her eyes to discover that the couch was being transported by floating across the room with her on top of it. One could explain doors opening and closing by themselves being due to not being latched properly and a breeze caused it to open and close. This explanation could not be applied to the sliding door between the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms. This sliding door often slammed open or closed. This was very unsettling. Quite a few times my parents came into my room in the middle of the night to see why I was screaming. I was not aware of screaming. As far as I knew I was sound asleep. They would describe the screaming as if I had ""seen bloody heads rolling across the floor."" There were times my parents acted out of character. They would be much harsher than one would expect. Shortly before my Mom passed away she told me that the change of life made her ""strange."" I asked her what she meant and she told me that one time she was chatting across the picket fence with our elderly neighbor. She said that it took all her strength to force herself to go back into our house without attacking and strangling the neighbor. I told her, ""Mom, that wasn't the change of life - it was the ghosts. The ghosts made them say and do things that were out of character. I could see ""it"" in their eyes and their mannerisms - that they were ""different"", not themselves. I experienced times when I was attacked, pushed, and man-handled by the ghosts. I told my parents, and they told me that I was letting my imagination run away with me. Their invalidation of my experiences made life very difficult for me as there was no where to turn for help. Family and friends that visited were often treated to a ghost experience from simple footsteps and door knocking to having their blankets pulled off of them in the middle of the night by unseen hands. One time my Aunt was at our house for my birthday party. It was too late for her to drive all the way home, but she didn't want to sleep in the house. She slept out in our travel trailer with my teenage slumber party. One time we were watching television when Hans Holzer and Sybil Leek were visiting San Francisco. They were ghost hunters. They announced that if anyone thought their house was haunted that they would be glad to come out and get rid of the ghosts. I begged my parents to call them. They didn't want to because they didn't want anyone in the area to know the house was haunted. They said that when they sold the house that such information would prevent them from getting a good price. I was so hopeful and then crestfallen. When my parents retired and put the house on the market the ghosts became especially active. We had occupied the house for 15 years, and I think the ghosts were pretty happy with the arrangement. He told my Mom that he wanted to move into the travel trailer so they didn't have to be concerned with constantly cleaning and preparing for the stream of realtors streaming through the house with potential buyers. Then one morning my Dad announced that he was lowering the price on the house by a considerable amount. We all tried to discourage him from doing so since they were counting on the profit from the sale to buy retirement property and perhaps build a home. He wouldn't listen to our arguments. The house sold that day. Mom and I were sitting in the kitchen while Dad walked the new owners out to their car. Mom and I heard the back door open and slam closed. We heard footsteps coming up the back steps. We got up together and looked down the hall to the stairway. We could still hear the footsteps ascending the stairs, but there was no one to be seen. After they moved all of their things out of the house, handed over the keys, and had left the property for good, Dad confided why he insisted on moving into the trailer and lowering the price on the house. The night before they moved out into the trailer my Dad was startled awake by a hand over his mouth and nose. He was being suffocated by the man ghost, who we had come to call Dave. Dad was a strong guy, but he said that it took all the strength he had to wrestle away from the grip of the ghost. Dad turned to me an apologized for not believing me. We heard that the first renter in the house was a minister. I was elated thinking that a minister might pray the ghosts out of the house. The minister moved out almost as soon as he had moved in. After a series of short term renters the house was replaced by an apartment building. Neighbors told my parents that the house had been moved. I don't know if the house was moved, and if it was moved I wondered if the ghosts go with the house or haunt the apartment building built on the site. I know I would never want to go back and find out for myself.",15 Years of Terror,United States,Haunted places,2006-10-30,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=65
2,Haunted Places,"This all happened in the last four Days. Bear with me as while the incidents were short, they were rather malicious. I moved from Kansas City, Kansas to Riverside, MO after an insurance problem forced us to move to another state, so my son Ricky would be covered for some medication he needed. In Kansas it would cost us $4500 a month. In MO $2 a month due to different medications being covered in MO that are not in Kansas. So I moved and took both of my sons with me. My husband stayed in our home with both of our daughters. We frequently sleep at both homes so we can be together. The $800 in rent and bills is a heck of a lot cheaper than $4500 a month for his medicine. I moved into my apartment on the 9th of September 2013. These incidents happened on the 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th of September. The day I moved in was uneventful except for the fruit basket. I like my basket of fruit to sit dead center in the middle of the table. I moved it back into the dead center of the table at least 6 times that day. Then we finally pushed the table up against the wall to prevent the table from being jostled and slid the basket all the way to the back. When I came back inside the empty apartment, the fruit basket was slid dead center again. I checked the apartment but it was empty. The boys were both sitting on the front steps having a drink and rest. Weird but oh well. The first week goes well. It's a crisis week trying to make sure everyone is where they need to be. On Friday and Saturday my husband and girls stayed over and come Sunday evening we were alone with just me and the boys home. It was about 10:30 at night and I was sitting on the sofa on my laptop when I suddenly hear the most happiest of laughs. A man was in the room laughing out loud. He laughed for about 10 seconds, as if it had been startled out of him. I was chatting with friends online and told them I thought someone was on my balcony. So I went out and checked, but no one was there, nor were any of the other neighbors out on theirs. I reported back to my friends that it was all clear and headed to bed. I set my alarm on my phone and placed it on the occasional chair to charge then climbed in bed and went to sleep. I'm a ""sleep like a rock"" type of person and very difficult to rouse. So I was very confused to suddenly find myself awake at 3am. I sat for a moment to listen if the coffee pot had turned on and then went and checked my phone. As I'm standing by the door, next to the chair staring at the clock on my phone, I see a streak from the corner of my eye in the direction of the boys' room. I hear a loud crash and piercing scream come from my sons' room. Then I hear that happy, jovial laugh again, right in my ear. That ""I'm just a happy type of guy"" male laugh. I run for my sons' room, and find my oldest son Marcus, who is 13, sitting in bed covered in broken toy airplanes. The airplanes which at 11:00pm had been lined up ready for take off from the aircraft's carrier toy on the floor. And indeed they had taken off. Right into my son, the wall over his bed and the window. They had broken on impact with the wall and then fallen on my son's head. I don't mention the laughing to my sons, because I need them to go back to sleep. But I sat in the hallway all night watching over them. The next day I tell my husband the apartment is haunted and get a good laugh from him. We are scared and spend the whole day at the house, only returning home at 9:00pm to sleep. This time I was woken by the screams at 5:00am. Marcus is on his floor the blankets nearly cocooned around him, crying, saying ""Leave me alone, please leave me alone."" Ricky is sitting up in bed, confused and still half asleep, saying, ""What?"" over and over again. I get Ricky to lay down and take Marcus to my bedroom, get him calmed down in my bedroom and get the details from him. Marcus says he suddenly woke up as he hit the floor, the blanket wrapped tightly around him and a male voice in his ear telling him, ""Wake up, I'm going to get you"" and then just laughing. Laughing like he was so happy, or had a great surprise thrown for him. I tell him to sleep with me and get him settled back to sleep. This spirit has twice targeted my 13 year old son. First with violence, and then by pulling my son from the bed while threatening him. I'm not sure that he wrapped the blanket around my son. But in 13 years, I have never seen my son fully wrapped in a blanket like that. Marcus is the type of kid who lays down, throws the blanket out perfectly around him, flips on his stomach, goes to sleep and does not move a muscle all night. So how did the blanket get sideways and wrapped around his arms? You will have to come to your own conclusion on that one. Right now, I'm regretting having moved here. Scared to tell my landlord the place is haunted. And wondering what I can do to catch this spirit in the act to prove I'm not crazy. Besides the three actual ""scare you shipless"" incidents, we are having closets and cabinets open while we are gone, computers acting weird and crazy. One which had worked perfectly, suddenly started messing up. The disc drive kept opening and closing. We bought a new one. It was working fine sitting on the kitchen table. When I came out the next morning, 30 programs had been opened up. We have no animals, the boys were sound asleep. Oh and I missing about 30 Lighters. Stupid I know, but I usually drop them through the couch so I buy a lot and at the end of the week, fish them out from under. But they are not under the couch, in it or anywhere to be found. My entire supply of lighters went poof, one by one. So this is Day 8 in the new apartment. We have a Laughing Lighter Thief who doesn't like my 13 year old son.

3,Haunted Places,"I am now 13 years old. My parents decided to get divorced in 2010, and from then I have lived in 3 rental homes and I am now in a purchased home settled for a long time. I am an only child and 15 Church Close in Mountnessing, UK, which was the family home for us three. Anyway ever since I can remember that house was heavy with paranormal activity. It started from when I can remember around 8 or 9, so just before the divorce. It started with light things like when I was naughty and sitting on my staircase sitting sideways because I always felt like I was being watched. It was so powerful I could feel it as soon as I sat down. I would always sit there and cry and say sorry just to get away. My dad came home one morning. As he works nights, I was at my nan's and mum had left for work. He came to the kitchen to see the kettle turned on and boiling and the toaster was turned on but with nothing in it. This was around 9 am, my mum would have left at 8:30ish so the kettle wouldn't have been boiling since then. But then it really got scary. One night I remember so clearly a black figure walking down the long sip of my room towards the foot of my bed. Then it felt like 'it' jumped onto my legs and the bed was dipped, like it fell onto my bed. I was so scared to call my mum, I would go to scream but it was almost like I couldn't. Ever since this event still to this day I keep the light on at night. And since about a year ago, even though in a different house, I would start of sleeping in my mum's bed until she would take me to my bed. Back to the other house. Since that event I would lay in my mum's bed first, and I would wake up at 10:06 every night, as seen on the green illuminated alarm clock, and the bed would violently shake. It was not side to side though it was up and down it was WEIRD. Now the day before we were meant to move out due to the divorce my mum was sitting in the loft, very secure, to get the last boxes out. She said that something grabbed her leg and literally pulled her out the loft hatch, giving her a sprained wrist. She knew it was time to leave then. She left the boxes got, in the car and told the removal man to meet us there. I will post more stories about all my other houses since this. My mum's hairdresser is a very spiritual person and she did this thing with her hands over my head and she said that I was a portal or something that allows spirits to pass. I thought this was a load of rubbish and I didn't believe her at all until one night I was laying in bed and would find faces I've never seen before slide past my closed eyes. More on this soon.",15 Church Close,United Kingdom,Haunted places,2014-12-22,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=20992
4,Haunted Places,"One night me and my sister was asleep. Our dog was at the end of the bed. She had woken me up and told me that the bed moved. I was half asleep and told her that it was just the dog. Or that it was her having a dream that seemed real. She claimed that it really did moved and that she was scared. So I got up and looked around. But nothing was there. So I stayed awake with her to prove that it was just the dog moving. About five minutes of waiting the bed just moves on its own. We both ran out. Never again did we sleep in that room. In the same house, every morning when I wake up I'll go in the kitchen and notice every cabinet, drawers, every door was open in the kitchen. No one was home except for me. Another time (living with the same people but different house) they had left to visit family hours away. I stayed home. I heard aloud bang, so I thought they were home. But they weren't. When I looked, the bathroom door was closed when it was originally open. I'm starting to think they have a ghost following them because multiple things happened in that house. Between hearing little kids laughing or taking pictures of a glare and it erased itself off the camera. Never told the story until now. Still makes me wonder. When me and my sisters was younger we use to play with the Ouija board. One day we did it and our apartment door was opening and closing. But the chain was on so it didn't open up all the way. My sister went to go look outside but no wind or anything was there. So we did it again. And the door kept doing it. Eventually we threw the board under the couch and never touched it again.",14 And Something Wasnt Right,United States,Haunted places,2015-05-05,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=21742
5,Haunted Places,"My friend lived in the oldest house in the town we lived in. Her house was the first house to ever be built in the town. So we always made jokes about it being haunted as hell and how we could hear things. It never really scared us but we didn't dare taunt them either. She would have some weird dreams where she couldn't fully wake up, but there was a dark figure leaning over her. One night when I was over (I slept on the floor) she asked me the next morning if I had sat up for a little while. I of course told her no, that I had actually slept pretty well that night. Her face went pale telling me she woke up in the middle of the night and saw someone sitting up right, right where I was lying and sleeping. Mostly at night stuff happened, when you're barely awake, but one day it was the middle of the day and we both saw it. She and I had been hanging out and I was bringing her home. It was about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, so it was daylight out still. I pulled into her driveway and she said she wanted to wait to make sure someone was home so she wasn't locked out. So she texted her mom and her dad and we jammed out in my car while we waited for a response. Then we saw her mom look out the window at us, probably heard my music, and we both waved to her; ""Oh yup there she is!"" my friend said as she gathered her stuff and began getting out of my car. We said our goodbyes and I made my way home. Once I got home I noticed I had a text from that same friend and it read; ""So the door was unlocked and I came inside and nobody is here. I looked EVERYWHERE in this house. You saw my mom look out the window at us too, didn't you?"" I did... I had some issues staying over night there for a little while after that. Not to mention a year or so later, her mom called us freaking out wondering where we were one day, because apparently she yelled to us upstairs asking us if we were hungry for dinner and if she should make something and we answered. Then when she went up the stairs to talk to us, no one was there.","""oh Yup There She Is!""",United States,Haunted places,2017-10-30,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=25088
6,Haunted Places,"This story I'm about to tell actually happened to my mom and my two older brothers. I don't know much about the details as I wasn't born yet at the time. It happened in the 70's. My oldest brother was 3 or 4 maybe and the second oldest was still a baby. Dad was not around much as he was in the army back then. So its up to mom to take care of the whole family by herself. Sometimes they would go back to our hometown village to meet with my grandparents when they were still alive. They lived in a village located deep in the depth of Melaka. My grandparents house was situated deep in the woods. There were neighbours but was for few kilometers apart. And there were many huge tall trees in between making it hard to see other neighbours houses. The house was a wood shack like the ones you see besides a lake deep in the wood or mountains. My grandparents house was located near the end of the woods. In front of it you could see a wide green padi field and the legendary Ledang mountain behind it. It was majestic, breathtaking and a bit scary especially at night. You could see nothing. Total pitch black. One day my mom and brothers took a one hour bus ride from a nearby small town, got down at the local small police station, walk passed a grave site, half hour walk into the woods and finally arrived. Now, the story took place after few days after mom stays. One night, around midnight after she put down my brothers to sleep. She can feel that there something in the air like some bad thing's going to happen. My whole family got this thing about a sixth sense kind of thing. She could not get to sleep because of the bad feeling. That night was kind of windy. She can hear the cold breeze running through the trees. Hearing the wind blowing through like a howl and small branches fall on the rooftops makes her more worried. Around 2 a.m, suddenly it all stops. It was very quiet outside for a few moments. Suddenly my mom hears a heavy breathing sound like from a beast come from outside of the house. She could hear it coming closer to the house through the wood wall. The thing is getting closer. Suddenly it's starting to growls and roars. Its almost the same as roar of a tiger. Now that's a bit strange cause there has never been a tiger seen in this part of region. It has been populated by human for generations. My brothers got woken up by the roar. They were scared to death and my oldest brother quickly grab hold of mom for safety. The growl and roaring continues for a long time. After that it stops. After a few moment, the growling and roaring happened again, this time it starts to clawing and hitting the wall of the house. It continues for a much longer time. Now the strange and scary thing is the clawing, scratching and hitting sound was coming from various sides of the house at the same time. One time the sound came from the lower level of the wall, and other were like on the upper level and on the roof. It looks like the clawing was done by a beast that was as big as the house. My mom got more scared, she start to hold my brothers tight and cover themselves inside the blanket. The roaring and clawing got more and more loud as if it was angry with something or someone in the house. My grandparents woke up and rushed to my moms room. My grandpa tell grandma to look after mom and he went by himself and said that he will take care of it. My mom didn't know what my grandad did, not then, or now. It remains a mystery for her. The roars and clawing got more vicious. After a while the whole thing got calm down. The growls were fading away like the beast has walking away from the house. My granddad came back and said its all okay now, nothing to worry about. After that, everyone finally calmed down. My brothers went to sleep and my mom finally got to sleep as so tired from the ordeal. The next day everyone could not speak a thing that happened that night. They went outside to look, but there were no signs of clawing or anything that can proves something hit the house. It was very scary as my mom felt the house shake when the thing hits the house from outside. Grandad told mom to just forget what had happened and never worry again. As he was right, that was the only time it happened. Never again. After that, Mom heard stories from other villagers, that there used to be an odd man that lived at the end of the woods. Some had said that he used to practiced black art magic that involved some sort of tiger spirit. They said he can control the beast to use as a protection. One day he was found dead and the villagers were scared, if the story about his tiger spirit buddy were true and it got loose and will terrorize the the whole village. Luckily none of that happened. What happened that night might be a bit true to that story I guess. Mom also heard that once there were some hunters found a tiger cub in the woods, one of the hunters took it back with him. Old people used to say that if you did that kind of thing, the mommy tiger will come looking for its cub and it will hunt you down and not rest until she got back her cub. Maybe there is a true in that story too. Sorry for the long one. This is my first. More will be coming next.

7,Haunted Places,"Today I wish to share with you a story which was narrated by my grandma many years ago. They used to live in their native place in Pen, Panvel, Maharashtra, India during those days around 1950s. My grandma was just a child then. In those times, in India, there were huge joint families and it was common for one's parents, grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc to stay together in an ancestral home (It's called a WADA in Marathi). Possibly may have been constructed in the early 1900s. There was a small storeroom which was also 1+1 (ground + first floor) in the backyard. There was only a ladder though that could be used to climb to the first floor from inside the storeroom which usually remained locked with a rectangular flap in the ceiling of the ground floor. The bathrooms were also located in the backyard such that they covered 2 sides of the storeroom and the bathroom windows could give you a view of the storeroom. Now, many of the relatives were used to certain strange things happening around the storeroom like breathing or growling sounds, lights flickering in the bathrooms or the storeroom. Knocks being heard from the storehouse's first floor. The village people were robust those days and hardly had a care in their lives. But, that's when the intensity of the strange occurences increased and the knocks from the storeroom's ceiling turned into actual sounds of an unknown voice asking, ""MAY I STEP OUT?"" ""MAY I STEP OUT?"" Now, this freaked the hell out of everyone, so they invited an exorcist (BHAGAT) to the place and he almost immediately told them that there was something in the storeroom that was trapped there and wanted to be let out, but he couldn't figure out what it could be. So, he organized a small ritual in a couple of days which happened to be a NO MOON DAY (AMAVASYA). He had asked my great great grandfather to arrange for some things like flowers, incense, coconuts, rice, turmeric, Vermilion and A Live chicken etc. All was arranged. The BHAGAT chanted some mantras and carefully arranged all these things along a certain path starting from just under the ladder in the storeroom leading outside the gate of the actual home. So, you could see all these ritualistic things being scattered along the ground coconuts, rice, etc doused with red and yellow powder and finally a chicken with its leg tied with a string right at the main gate. After that, he ordered all of us to go inside the main house. My grandma and others went to the 2nd floor terrace to see what would happen. The BHAGAT chanted some more mantras after that and when he finally heard the call ""MAY I STEP OUT?"" ""MAY I STEP OUT?"" The BHAGAT replied, ""YES, COME OUT!"". As soon as he did, the 1st floors ceiling door snapped open and it was as if a cyclone had been liberated from that place, it followed the path of all the things that were laid on the ground, tossing everything out, coconuts being broken flying in the air, and finally the poor chicken which died as soon as the cyclone kind of thing passed through her and moved out of the main gate. As soon as it did, the BHAGAT, closed the gate and tied a lemon and chillies to the gate and called the elders outside. He said, it was probably just a spirit which was trapped to that ground and needed to be liberated. And that's how the entire story concluded and never again did anyone hear the same ""MAY I STEP OUT?"" again. Anyway, hope you liked the story here. There are a few things that she told me after narrating the story which are very interesting about this. But I would share them in my comments after. Peace.

8,Haunted Places,"My small contribution, which has led to some continued interest in the paranormal. We moved house when I was 10. Bigger house, two story, built in the late 40's IIRC. Early on I,at least, would hear my name called and it wasn't my mom. (Went and asked.) My younger brother complained of seeing faces on the wall at night. The biggie occurred one early evening as I went up stairs to the second floor, the stair way left the main floor and went up to a landing, turned right and went up another 7-8 steps. At the top there was a hall with entrances to the bath, and my room on the left, entrances to my folks room and younger sister's room on the right. I was about half way up from the landing to 2nd floor level when something white and irregularly shaped came out of my folks room. It might have been an arm given the height but had no real shape aside from an irregular length. There was no one else from the family up stairs. I don't think my feet touched the steps on the way back down, I went through the house to the TV room in the back of the first floor. I stopped next to my mom and she said, ""you are just white."" I don't remember if she said any more and I blurted out that an arm had come out of their (mom & dad's) bedroom. To which my dad said,""Was it a man's or woman's arm?"" I replied, ""It was white!"" I had never been so scared, never saw it again and when ever I went up stairs in the evening I had to screw up my courage and make sure the light in the up stairs hall was on. If the story ended here it probably wouldn't mean much. Many times we, as a family, would leave the house in the evening and my dad would see and complain that the attic light was left on by somebody. The attic stairs were accessed through a door in their bedroom BTW. One evening, as we were all called down stairs to get in the car and go somewhere, I made a point to be the last down. I turned off the attic light, which had a wall mounted toggle switch that wasn't the least bit worn out, having a firm click. I joined the family and as we pulled in front of the house in the car, my dad complained that the light in the attic was on. It was, I looked for myself and reported to my dad that I had turned the light off before we left. The subject of ghosts came up, several times, but being a religious family, there was no further discussion. One of the times I was visiting town long after my folks had moved again I went by that house at night, the light was on.;)",10 Years Old And New House,United States,Haunted places,2018-02-20,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=25437
9,Haunted Places,"In the late summer of 2010, I was working from home as an artist in Greensboro, NC. My daughter had just started back to school and my nearly 3 year old son was home with me full time. It was a hot and muggy late morning and I left my son in his room playing with his toy cars while I went to the carport to prepare my paints and tools for a project. Within 15 minutes of my preparations, my son had opened the screen door, leaning on it, with an annoyed look on his face. I asked my son if he was ok or maybe ready for some lunch when he said, exasperated ""No, mom. I'm not hungry, but those kids are back."" Unsure to whom he was referring as we had few young children in our neighborhood and the ones we did have around were in school. I distractedly asked him what kids, still arranging my tools of my trade when he said ""You know, the three kids from the fire. The ones in my closet. They want to play with my cars but I want to play alone."" My children walked and talked very early, so I was accustomed to the luxury of having full, clear conversations with my 2 and a half year old. Apparently, I did not react to his complaint quickly enough, so he stepped outside and spoke to me as if I was the child. My toddler walked over to me, took my hand to lead me inside to his bedroom and said to me in a patient voice ""Come, on mom. Come with me and I'll show you."" I was smirking at his heavy sigh, limited patience, and his insistence that I look. We went to his room, filled with sunshine and with his toy cars littered about in mid-play. He released my hand, threw open the accordion closet doors, throwing his hands before him gesturing toward these alleged children. ""See?!"" He proceeded to look at me, as if to ask ""now do you believe me?"". Looking at the closet and seeing no one in there, I played along. ""Oh, yeah I remember them."" I went on to announce to the toys, clothes, and other items in the closet: ""House rules are that anyone who is kind may stay and play nice. If you can't be nice you have to go."" My son smirked and shook his head. ""Mom,the kids that died in the fire don't want to share."" A little spooked, I rallied my thoughts only to feel as if I was staring off into space... Like I'd been daydreaming for 45 minutes in a boring high school class. Suddenly, a story my mother told me about years ago appeared in my mind's eye. My mother's best friend perished in a fire along with 3 of her 4 young children. It was in New York City in the late 50's or early 60's. I could see, in my head, these 3 huddled young children barefooted and cowering on the floor of my son's bedroom closet; 2 girls and one boy wearing night gowns and pajamas. They looked dated, as if 1950s or early 60's. I could FEEL their fear, panic, confusion, and even their resentment of not being rescued. A sadness and understanding washed over me, like I absorbed what these 3 children were expressing: we were so afraid from the heat of the fire and the smoke. We hid together in our closet and huddled close to protect ourselves. We cannot find our way to our mother and we just want to go home... This ""daydream"" of thoughts and images was suddenly interrupted by my son who said ""Mom, they need to go home now. Make them go home, ok?""... So, I said with tears in my eyes from either sympathizing or actually ""knowing"" their story, I said out loud: ""I am so sorry for how scared you were. I am so sorry that no one came for you or looked for you in the closet before the fire and smoke did. It's ok to be afraid but it's time to go to your mom now. If you want to stay and play nicely for a bit that's fine but then you have to go."" My son looked satisfied with that speech and as I reached for my son's hand to walk him out of his room toward to kitchen to help me make some lunch he said ""No thanks. I want to play too and eat later."" I nodded and walked out a bit still shocked from what just occurred. I returned ten minutes later as lunch was ready. I asked him if the kids were playing fairly now. He looked up and ""Huh? Oh them?"" He waved his hand and went back to playing cars, ""They left right after you did."" The room that my son had used to be my daughter's. She never liked the room, especially the closet and developed night terrors when we moved into the house in 2002. Something about that closet felt like it let awful things in and out of it, to the point where my son refused to sleep there up until we finally moved from it in 2015. Moods shifted for the worse, foot steps, smoky figures, and more came and went. Getting away from that house and that neighborhood proved beneficial as we've come to find out that there were suicides, sudden deaths, shootings, and other unfortunate tragedies that occurred to families that lived in the houses that stood directly next to and across from it... My marriage to my children's father was solid until it deteriorated in significant and frightening ways from 2003 on. The family who owned it before us also had a contentious divorce and experienced behavioral issues with their son and daughter. To this day, I prefer not to go to the city of Greensboro if I can avoid it due to our experiences from 2002 - 2015.","""the Kids In My Closet Are Back""",United States,Haunted places,2018-03-04,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=25481
10,Haunted Places,"Now this took place some time ago so I wasn't present to witness it, more likely that I'm glad I wasn't there to witness it. So on Saturday night my aunty and I were at her house, having a few drinks and telling stories etc. She had mentioned a story and it involved the very small rural village of Adavoyle, my Grandads birthplace as well as family home. For whatever reason my grandparents house had to be left vacant for 2 weeks so they had to stay in mobile homes which were basically static trailers, they didn't want to so the only option was to stay in Adavoyle to which the mood quickly changed and the mobile homes didn't seem too bad. I had asked why and this is where the story truly begins. My family has been dropping like flies, now you may say ""That's a morbid statement."" But it's true, not a year goes by where a distant relation kicks the bucket but that's a different story. In my Grandad's Birth home a family member died and he was laid out upon the Kitchen table as that's what they did back then, blood was discarded into the pig pen and ever since that the house was known to be unlucky. My Grandad and his two brothers were left the house in a will, it contained a small farm yard out in the backyard which then stretched out into a massive field with a single fairy tree in the middle. Some time after the funeral they were in the field when my Grandad spotted someone... ""Whos that by the tree?"" He said, the other two looked on and couldn't see anyone. But no sooner had he said that within 5 seconds this... Thing was sprinting towards them. A massive field that not even a fully grown healthy man could descend as fast as it did. All three men turned and bolted for the gate, desperate to get out to the point where one was willing to sacrifice the other. When they were out of the field they turned to look at the creature chasing them and it had vanished. They gave it the name ""The Rubber Man"" as it practically bounced down the field towards them. TO THIS DAY my Grandad refuses to talk about it much, he will repeat the question, nervously laugh and brush it off only to talk about something else, but I'm not finished with this story just yet. One of the Brothers (We'll call him Dave) would stay there now and again, but only if there was someone else there as banging could be heard on the walls and doors slam to the point where he was being questioned by angry neighbours. He once even cried at the thought of sleeping alone in the house, a grown, fit and healthy man. Work needed to be done on the house as parts were starting to crack. So instead of getting professionals my Grandad decided to do it for free. He had to knock down a wall and when he did he was presented with a door. As soon as Dave heard of this his only response was ""Don't open the door."" When asked why he again responded ""I said don't open the f###ing door."" And so it wasn't opened, simply replastered up. I must be insane writing this at 2:20 in the morning when I start college tomorrow... Anyway, hope you enjoyed the family story.",'the Rubber Man',Ireland,Haunted places,2018-09-02,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=26018
11,Haunted Places,"My Name is Larry Cedeno and I live in South San Francisco California. I live 3.1 miles from the town of Colma, known worldwide as the ""City Of Souls,"" it's the smallest city in San Mateo County with over 1,509 residents and 1.5 million ""souls."" At this time, there are sixteen cemeteries in colma, including a pet cemetery. Ten years ago, we moved into our current house, my Children, my wife and the dogs have all had experience's from time to time as I'm describing in this letter. Weird things started occurring sometime after we moved into our current house. There was a lot of creaking and weird noises. We were told the house was settling in. If you were in your bedroom, doors would open and close by themselves. Voices coming from other rooms. Shadows streaking across rooms or down the stairs. We have a motion sensor bathroom light switch that controls our bathroom light located on the second floor off to side of the bedrooms. A staircase leads down stairs to the main living room. If you were down stairs on the couch, you would hear footsteps coming down the stairs. One time this happened I was on the couch with my two dogs, the bathroom motion light went on, the stairs started creaking, my dogs stared at the stairs, and I watched their heads tracking something slowly across the living room. I grabbed my keys and left the home. One night I was watching TV in the family room and my youngest daughter Savannah was running around the house with a toy laser pointer. I told her to knock it off and to stop playing with the laser pointer. Some moments later, I saw a glow of light emanating from our dining room coming down the hallway. Thought it was my daughter again with the laser pointer. As I leaned off my chair and looked down the hallway to correct my daughter, again instead of seeing her I saw an ORB the size of a Globe that contained a man just the neck up slowly coming down the hallway. I leaned back into my chair and said what the hell. Seconds later I was looking at the wall leading into the family room I could still see the glow of this object still coming down the hallway and it finally breached the doors of the family room moving very slow about 8ft off the ground. I got a very good look at this thing it was a man from the neck collar up in a globe that looked like it was filled with blue sky light. He had roman style hair and beard all white with some kind of gold tassel around a portion of his neck color. It did not see me at first but then he saw me sitting off to the side and this thing cruised over to me, stopped and looked right at or down at me. I was in a recliner at the time. The odd thing is I was not scared as I stared at this Orb / Man in a globe of some sort. Located in this room, are bright fluorescent lights located in ceiling. They kicked on and the whole room lit up immediately. It caused me to look at the light switch on the wall to see if one of my family members had turned it on. No one was there. This happened in a split second. I looked at the switch on the wall and turned my head back at the Orb. ""It was gone"". It also triggered two motion flood lamps that lead outside the doors of this room, which leads into the back yard. I got up immediately and ran upstairs to my bedroom, and sat on the bed just staring at my door. A few days later after, I calmed down and reflected on what I saw. I realized that this thing or Orb created a diversion and went through the glass doors that led to the back yard tripping the motion lights on the way out. There is one more important thing I need to add. When we first looked at this house, it was not listed on the market. We were looking at a house around the corner when the realtor company called the agent and said they just received a listing for a court divorce sell. The realtor said, ""Let's go look at it - Its right around the corner."" We arrived at what would be our current house today. There were deadbolt locks on all the doors including the front door. You needed a key to get in and out of most of the doors the wife was living upstairs in the bedroom facing the driveway and the husband was living in the back of the house. It was almost like the movie War of the Roses. They built an extension wall and separated the house from each other including separate entrances, kitchens, and bathrooms. This wall and extra kitchen were knocked down after we moved in to restore and open the house back up. Today my wife and I are separated and agreed to divorce. We live in the same condition minus the wall. She lives upstairs in the room facing the driveway and I live in the back of the house as the last owners husband did. Coincidence? I believe it is the house. Thank you for taking the time to read this...

12,Haunted Places,"I am a lover of all things paranormal. It has interested me my whole life. However, I have not had many first-hand experiences or encounters with the paranormal... Besides one. I was young, maybe about 5 years old at the most. I lived in a two-story apartment in Dayton, Ohio with my mother and father at the time, before my sister was born. I am going on 26 years old now, there isn't much of my childhood that I can clearly remember. It seems over the years every thing becomes more and more fuzzy like I am trying to tune the static out of an old T.V. But I will always remember this about living in this apartment; I had an imaginary friend. I remember having an imaginary friend. Very distinctly. My imaginary friend was a boy. He didn't have a name that I can recall. I remember locking myself in my room for hours and playing. Jumping on the bed, playing with dolls. Talking to him. But that is the extent of what I can remember about him. It wouldn't be until years later after we moved from that apartment and I was older, that my parents would share a story with me that haunts me to this day. They knew I had an imaginary friend. That was all I did day in and day out. I developed this imaginary friend after we had moved into this apartment. According to my parents, I started doing bad things. Things that I normally did not do prior to having this imaginary friend. I would have accidents on myself and pee on the floor in my room like a dog. I would lock my cats in the trunk that sat outside of my door in the hallway. My attitude and the way I talked to my mother seemed to get worse too. When confronted about my actions and the things that I was doing, they said I would blame it on my cousin Amber (who had never even been over before). My mother in particular has always told me that she hated my room in that apartment. She hated to be in my room by herself, as she would always feel as if something was watching her. There was one day in particular, where things got really strange. My father was working a third shift job at the time. He had worked some over-time that day and came home and wanted to go to sleep. He walked up the stairs, past my room where my door was shut, and into his room across the hall. My parent's story about what happened has never faltered or changed as many times as I have heard it. My dad could hear me in my room playing with what seemed to be another kid. He heard two voices. I suppose I could have easily been replying to myself in different tones to give my imaginary friend a voice, except he claims there were times our voices over-lapped and he could clearly tell he was hearing two different children. Laughing, playing, being kids. He called for my mother to come to their room so that he could tell her to go tell me and ""that neighbor boy"" to keep it down so he could sleep. My mother insisted that she did not hear anyone else with me, and that there was no other kids in the room except me. Sure enough when they checked, I was alone. Not sure when we ended up moving from that apartment, but we did. My parents claimed like flipping a switch, as soon as we moved out, I no longer had an imaginary friend. I can not sit here and tell you that yes, it was ghost! Because, well, I just don't know. I for sure know, and remember, the imaginary friend. I can't ever re-call that anything weird ever happened to me during this time, like hearing him, or seeing him. I only remember the act of acting like there was someone with me to play with, and speaking at this thing that I could not see. But to my parents, there was definitely something more than just a child playing make-believe. To top it all off, a few years later, a friend of my dad's moved into the same apartment with his daughter and son. They knew nothing of the experience we had in the home. Imagine how my parents felt to learn that this friend's daughter took my old room, and a few weeks upon moving in, she had her very own, imaginary friend. She continued to have an imaginary friend until the day that they too, moved from the home. This story is one of my most prized-possessions. When the topic of ghosts is on the table, it is the one I whip out. It is eerie, and some-what unsettling. But it one-hundred percent, true. This apartment is relatively close to where my grandparents currently live and have lived for many, many years. Over all these years there has been a handful of occasions where we have drove, or walked, past it. I find that every single time, I find myself looking up into the window of what used to be my old room, wondering if he might be looking back at me and remember me.","""imaginary"" Friend",United States,Haunted places,2021-12-29,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=27770
13,Other,"I just 'had' to submit this as it happened this past Tuesday on 2/6/2024. I was driving to the credit union early in the morning. I had just gotten off of work, and wanted to take care of a bill, and draw a little money out. The road I take is called Rocky River Drive. It takes me to Brookpark road which is right in front of Cleveland Hopkins Airport. I mention the airport for a reason. I was going down the road when, of course, I hit a red light. I'm sitting there, and glance up to the sky. I do that frequently since I'm accustomed to aircraft going overhead. Oh, yeah! I saw a jet. Blue body with a red, blue, and yellow tail. However, it was 'completely' motionless. Just hanging there, and 'not moving'. Also, there was no noise. Now usually jets make that unmistakable sound, but 'this' was absolutely silent. I did a double - no 'triple'-take. I could not believe that it wasn't moving at all. If I had been on the roof of one of the houses I could've thrown a stone at it. So, it was close enough for me to observe. Apparently the other people around me noticed it, too. The woman in the car next to me grabbed her smart phone, and placed it on the dash to get a shot of it, and I saw the guy in the car behind me doing the same with his cell phone. Unfortunately 'my' trac phone was zipped up in my purse, and turned off at the time. I had no time to retrieve it. On top of that, I was in traffic, and the light changed. I 'had' to proceed when the light turned green. I couldn't possibly block traffic. I went to the credit union slightly shook from what I, and others saw, but I had to calm down. It's not too good to drive in a shaken state, I assure you. On the way back it was gone. I have seen things like what I saw on a show called 'Paranormal Caught on Camera' on the Travel channel. However, I viewed those videos with a certain amount of skepticism. I thought it was all brilliant C.G.I... They, now, have my profound apologies. If I hadn't actually witnessed it along with the other drivers (I didn't notice any side-walk traffic at the time), I wouldn't have believed it. I have 'tried' to rationalize this away, but cannot seem to come up with a scientific explanation for it. Sorry, folks! Has this happened to anyone else on this site? If so, PLEASE tell me about it, and what 'you' might have for an explanation. I'm not to sure about the 'glitch in the matrix' line of thought, but nonetheless, I cannot explain it. I'm still a little bum-fuzzled over it. Not to mention, still a bit shook up.

14,Other,"My parents were married in the summer of 1984. The reception took place within a small church in my hometown of Kingston, Ontario. The church was adjacent to a vast cemetery, renowned for being the burial site of Sir John A. MacDonald, Canada's first prime minister. My maternal grandfather was in attendance and at the time was suffering from severe heart problems. His physical health was very visibly deteriorating. Once my parents recited their vows and the marriage was official, they decided to take a group photo outside the church to commemorate the occasion. At first, all seemed perfectly happy and natural, right up until my grandmother received the developed photos and noticed something unexpectedly strange and rather shocking. At first glance, she noticed the image of my grandfather standing there in the far-right side of the picture wearing his favourite grey tuxedo and a joyous smile glued to his face. He was standing between two of their mutual friends and a mysterious white mist surrounding my grandfather's image was clearly noticeable. The most perplexing part was how he was the only one who seemed to have attracted the mist. At surface level, one may surmise that this was merely coincidental or perhaps there may have been issues with the camera that was used. However, following my parents wedding, a few more pictures of my grandfather were taken and upon having them developed, the same fog was still present in every one he was featured in. In July of 1987, my grandfather passed away at the age of fifty-two. My grandmother was understandably distressed by this phenomenal set of events, and she immediately interpreted the mist as sort of a prophetic message that her husband would soon pass away. From her perspective, the mist engulfing my grandfather's image was very questionably a preemptive warning that the spiritual realm would soon intervene with our metaphysical reality and transport him to the afterlife. These photographs are still in my grandmother's possession. To this day, the image of the peculiar mist consuming my grandfather within the astounding photograph remains a mystery.",A Misty Memory,Canada,Misc,2024-02-13,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28262
15,Other,"I just moved to Kentucky from Illinois. I've been here a month and until last night I've not experienced a haunting. The place I left had a lot of action that was happening regularly. I even accidentally recorded 2 ghost voices and heard those voices myself afterwards a few times. The reason I'm writing this is because I'd had an odd experience for many years. A clicking noise waking me up, much different from a ghost or poltergeist. At first I worried it was my brain making up the noise. I still don't know. I do know I'm not comfortable responding or communicating with spirits because I've had bad experiences in the past. I don't know if someone is try to communicate that is good or bad. I'd had hauntings my entire life. Anyway I was awakened by the clicking noises sounding metallic. It was a little different this time as it was moving around my room and clicking. I had to prayer protection at least 3 times and center my mind on myself on Jesus to finally have it stop. I feel it was trying to scare me and I know somethings feed on fear. So not something I have the strength on my own to communicate with. Anyone out there that knows of this please respond. I have to confess I kind of enjoy having ghosts in my life yet I don't let myself open up to them in case they affect me in a negative way. I also have dreams occasionally that are totally different from regular dreams and am somewhat psychic. Also premonitions happen occasionally. I am 71 years old and at age 29 I had an amazing spiritual healing through dreams for 10 days which started when a Nun and Priest prayed for me.

Well, for those who are new or do not remember those stories there is one story posted with this account so have a peek first maybe? (Not trying to get people's attention, but just wanted to make it easier to understand this story.) I am currently in Hokkaido the coldest place I have ever stayed in my life. I lack experiencing paranormal activities other than the ""chanting"" outside my house every night. (Or should I say I am lacking of experiencing new paranormal activities?) I take it as something positive because maybe I am protected by local good spirits (not sure but nothing really happened honestly so... It sounds fine for me). I rode my motorbike to the downtown part of Sapporo to maintain it and stayed in an old Japanese Style Hot Spring bathhouse (we call those Ryokan). Not too bad with only breakfast (which I skipped for some reason). I was assigned to a Japanese Style bedroom with both Tatami and carpet, comfortable for me because I do not want to sleep on the Futon sets (where is my Japanese DNA?) lol. It was during the night I was staying in that Ryokan I found that my wallet was gone. It was not possible that I dropped it somewhere because it was chained to my chappers (the half pants like outfit for long distance bikers). The phone in the room suddenly rang and it was the Kamisan (a female service manager) ""Ryujin-sama, we need to apologize for what has happened.""

""Oh ok... So you got my wallet? And it was in my room... How did you know that I lost it? I came alone, and who told you guys what?"" The staff explained that there is a young man wearing a blue shirt ringing the front desk bell this evening naming a staff member saying that she had a wallet that does not belong to her and that wallet was stolen from the number of my room. I checked-in and later went to the Public bath where the hot spring was, during that time period a staff went into my room and quickly came out hiding something in her hand, and that was my wallet. A young man wearing blue shirt... It sounded familiar... But I was not sure... Still not too sure... I thought back when I was in Brazil... That spiritual boy... After having my wallet back, I went to close the curtain in my room and from the reflection, I thought I saw a figure of a boy wearing a bright blue shirt...

17,Other,"A month ago, I was riding my bike home after school and I was in a pretty bad mood because of school stuff. My mind was pre-occupied and I was thinking about random stuff until at a point, I took a turn and motor bike came straight at me. It didn't hit me. Instead it turned at the right time. But me being a scaredy cat lost balance and fell off my bike. The person who rode the motor bike stopped and turned around to help me. He was a really sweet person. He helped me up and kind of fixed my bike's chain because of the fall. It was also raining and my jacket had gotten all dirty and messed up, he handed me his coat. After that he insisted on walking me home because my knee got injured. He also took my bike in hand. I agreed and we started walking. He introduced himself as Gavin and he was 19 and I introduced myself. We talked and I ended up telling him about what was bothering me and at some points he laughed. Some points he supported me. We were about to reach my street but I thought it would be wise to let him drop me by my street instead of my house for reasons like 'stranger danger' and my strict parents. So I let him drop me by my street. Before leaving he told me ""Life is like a broken puzzle which sometimes you need to either stick or tape the torn pieces into a complete one to let the whole puzzle make sense."" Believe it or not that advice made so much sense. We said our good byes and before leaving he placed a kiss on my forehead. I was touched and I might have grown to have a slight crush right there. We parted ways, and here's where things didn't make sense. I must have taken two steps before I turned around to watch him leave but he wasn't there. It was as if he disappeared into thin air. I took a turn and tried searching for him but he wasn't there. He could not have possibly run that fast for him to completely disappear. Even if he did run, I should have heard his footsteps. But he wasn't there. I reached home and sat down on my bed recalling this whole experience. From the almost crash to me leaving him outside my street. I realized except for his name I didn't know anything about him. I did ask him once where he studied. But he seemed almost hesitant to answer until he told me 'Some college in Amsterdam'. The next day while I was biking to school I stopped seeing a black coat. I picked it up and the sense of chills ran through me because it was the same coat Gavin handed to me. It had the initials G.K. On the sleeves. I was scared and didn't believe what was going on because why would Gavin's coat be lying on the middle of the bike path? I left the coat and I was paranoid the whole day. Later that night, I saw a dream of my dead best-friend who passed away 3 years ago. He was there with me and we were simply talking until I saw his motor bike which he was sitting on while I was sitting on some rock. The motor bike seemed so familiar and then it clicked for me. It was Gavin's motor bike. I looked up at my best friend and pointed at the bike with a very paranoid expression. He looked down at the bike and then up at me with a playful smirk... I woke up sweating and panting at that dream. Nothing made sense at that point. This whole experience made me want to believe I was crazy. I tried talking to my friends here but they said I was going insane. Maybe I am. I don't know if I need help. But when I think about it, the whole experience may have been confusing and extreme, but not once I was feeling scared with Gavin. I just don't know what he was.

I also experienced going to a ""disco"", and I enjoyed it. I also experienced riding a carabao. My cousin's told me about the 'mangkukulam' 'mambabarang' there. They said that when I bumped into someone specially when old people... Don't look them in the eyes and just walk straight... And also when stranger pats you on the shoulder, you have to pat them back because maybe if they put a cursed on you, you have to pat back their shoulders too, to revert the cursed. One night, my cousin cooked noodles and hotdogs for us for breakfast. While we were eating, my uncle woke up, went into the bathroom to take a bath, and dressed up. He's looking in the mirror while combing his hair. When I looked at him in the mirror, I saw him headless. I cried. I was so scared, and I told my family what I just saw. My grandmother covered his head with a black cloth and hit him in the head and asked my uncle to take off his clothes. They burned the clothes and told my uncle not to go outside that day because something bad was going to happen. The next day, my uncle woke up early and said that he's going to church to pray for what happened last night because he's scared too. He dressed up and left. After so many hours, our grandfather got a call. It was our neighbor. She said that my uncle is dead; he got hit by a ten-wheeler truck and his head was crushed... It's been 5 months and I still can't get over with it, because I'm the one who saw him headless.

19,Other,"A couple of years ago I mentioned there was a girl's voice I would sometimes hear in my bedroom and if you've been following my stories this would probably make this a continuation. Over the years I've kind of developed a sixth sense and been able to see the beyond. As stated in my previous stories I heard a little girl speak to me but never really saw or fully speak to her until this event. One early morning as I was slowly waking up but still a bit sleepy, I noticed my alarm clock didn't go off. Normally I always wake up to the sound of the alarm to get ready for work but sometimes I naturally wake up and lay down for a bit until it goes off. That morning I decided to close my eyes and rest a little. As I was resting I felt a presence on my bed as if some one was resting on the side. In my mind's eye I could see a little girl with blonde hair tied back smiling at me. She was on the floor by the bedside and her arms were folded, placed upon the bed side and her head was resting on her arms, looking at my face with adoration. She spoke in the same voice I recognized those years ago. ""I think... You really should get up now."" I mumbled ""No, let me sleep..."" She responded with a cheeky smile ""No, I think you really, really, reaaaally should get up now"" speaking with confidence that she knew something was going to happen. In my head I thought, why on earth would I be having such a conversation? Was this a dream? It felt like it was a warning of some sort. Still half a sleep, I slowly opened my eyes and quickly got up to see if she was there but she had gone. I got a bit weirded out but felt happy--Suddenly the alarm goes off! Just seconds after that dreamlike conversation, perfect timing. That morning I kept thinking if that was just my imagination or a day dream but I really did appreciate her for waking me up just seconds before the alarm would go off. As I write this I just noticed the side of my bed is a bit lopsided as if something has left an impression, like someone has been resting on the side of the bed for a very long time on a regular basis... A couple of months later on another morning around early spring, I had woken up to the sound of someone in my household turning the shower on in the bathroom. I didn't take much notice as this was a regular occurrence and so I slowly went back to sleep. I had a dream and in the dream I was an archaeologist digging up something, in the dream I seen little bits of paper with writing on it and noticed my name materialize on the paper. Then I heard my name being called out to me. The voice kept repeating my name over and over again. Realizing I've had such an experience before meant that someone was trying to wake me up. Much to my annoyance I willed myself awake and looked at my surroundings. No one was there in my room but I could still hear the shower turned on as water was sporadically hitting the floor. I thought it was bizarre for my mind the conjure up such a scenario as I've had this happen to me twice only for someone to be there waking me up so to see no body was there was bizarre. I rested my head as a laid down. ""Jack!"" suddenly I heard a man say my name loud and clearly in my right ear. It startled to me! My heart began to race and I got scared and then the fear turned to angry. I called out one of the names of the people I live with but I got no answer, I looked at my bedroom door still hearing the shower from the bathroom, this gave me comfort. I guess they didn't hear me. I slowly rested my head, this time wide awake. The fact that a disembodied man's voice kept saying my name to wake me up really freaked me out. I really don't want to experience that again. If there's ways to stop that, I really hope readers can comment and let me know. I much rather have the little girl wake me up because that voice and the way it was trying to wake me up disturbed me. Sometimes I think maybe it's just an over-active imagination but then again I've experienced real things with others that didn't make sense before, I hope it's not something too bad...",Ghosts Waking Me Up,United Kingdom,Apparitions / voices / touches,2024-06-17,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28371
20,Other,"I have always been a believer in the undead. Whether it be simple lights flicking off, or bookshelves falling over, I have always considered myself connected to the undead. When I was younger, I remember very distinctly a young girl who would float around my house in a Victorian-style nightgown. She never attacked me, but just smiled and floated away. Looking back, I believe this was a kind spirit. I have told many people about this but was put down. That's why I couldn't believe my eyes when a few of my close friends invited me to a haunted house, where ghosts and doppelgangers had supposedly been spotted. I immediately accepted the offer and packed some offerings (herb and sweet syrups.) A few weeks later, the day rolled around, and the four of us clambered into the van. The moment we arrived, I felt like someone was following us. So, I was completely distraught when my friend pulled out some candles, and demanded we did a ritual. I declined, but everyone around me started egging me on, so, I caved. We set up some candles, drew on the wooden floor with paints, and waited. As expected, nothing showed up, as our ritual was inaccurate and frankly offensive. My friends, disappointed, quickly left the room to try and find something else. Meanwhile, I cleaned, blew out all but one candle, and placed my offerings gently in front. Just like that, something rose out of the floor, grabbed the herbs and bowl of syrup, and ran off. I watched it, shocked. It looked at me for just a moment. I couldn't shake the feeling that it looked EXACTLY like a grown-up version of the young girl who used to appear at night. I opened my mouth to call my friends but decided not to. They might be rude to her, and right now, I was fine with just the two of us in the room. The spirit smiled and then disappeared. On cue, my friends came in, and asked me 'Why I looked like I saw a ghost.'

21,Other,"I am a person who believes in both good and bad energies that we have in the universe existing parallelly. And also since I was a kid, I have had some sightings of spirits and sense negative energies around me, but I was too naïve to ever notice them. This incident confirmed everything that I have been avoiding so far. I also have known that I get some dreams which can convey message of some sort about my real life and those around me, which I never considered as a gift but after some time I started noting them down on my diary since my family doesn't believe me. I started working when I was 19 years old in a call Centre in Mumbai. It was mostly night shifts so I could manage my graduation studies and my job simultaneously to pay my tuition fees. I was working in a reputable company which I would rather not name in the year 2019. I had to do the last shift so if I came from college late I could still manage. As it was a UK process, the timings I used to pick up for the shift was 5:30 pm to 2:30 am at night in UK time which was the last shift we could do. One night I was working late and it had been past 2:30 am because we had to leave notes on customers accounts and I had some follow-ups to do as well. As it was a Friday night and we were celebrating RNR (which is to reward best employees) and everybody logged out a bit early to go out and party. So the floor was empty around 3:00 am. I was new with the job and hence had a take quite a bit time to complete the procedures and updates. It was colder than usual that night and quieter. I ignored assuming its just the AC and it was not my first time working late. A guy approached me and asked me if I was having any trouble doing the work and needed any help. I smiled and gently replied ""No, thanks"" because I didn't want my superiors to know that I am taking a lot of help as they were underestimating me already considering I was young and a fresher and it was a very toxic workplace. He also asked me when I was logging out. I replied ""As soon as I finish working on the notes"". He said ""Don't stay up late a lot and relax, stress isn't very good for your health"". I was happy that someone finally understands and got back to my work. When I was finished, I looked for the guy but he wasn't there at all and I thought he must've left after talking to me. The next day I came to my shift and I was searching for the guy, I couldn't find him. I logged in and I was checking on my emails and updates for the day when a strike of thunder ran through my spine and read condolence notice about the same guy with his picture. He died the same day he met me but in the afternoon by suicide under work pressure. I couldn't believe my eyes that how could it be possible when I met him just yesterday night. I asked my team leader and told him that I saw him last night. He made fun of me that I was hallucinating and said that the guy who died didn't report to work and was found dead in his apartment yesterday afternoon by his wife. I felt so sorry for him and decided to leave that workplace fearing the consequences that this job did to him.

22,Other,"My first time posting on this forum. I've been experiencing unexplainable phenomena ever since I can remember. I want to engage with opinions from different backgrounds about my experiences. I'm open to discussion and no opinion you form about it is unwelcome. In any case, I'll skip to the experience itself. I'm about 10 at the time of experiencing this. I grew up with Grandparents in rural Mymensingh. Theirs was a tin-shed house, about a hundred meters away from a vehicle-worthy road. The earthen path that connected my grandparent's house to that road wound around a deep pond and went through a bamboo bush. In November of 2011, we were visiting my grandparents. My father had taken me to the bazaar in the evening to buy some groceries, and then sent me back with them and told me to come back with some money because he wanted to gamble with his old friends. While going back to the house with groceries, I heard a sound in the water as I passed by the pond. It was a splash, but a quiet and oddly drawn-out one. I stopped to see what was making that noise. There was a half-moon in the sky, but the shadows of the bamboo bush fell on the pond, obscuring my view. But the water rippled and lapped, and whatever had entered the water seemed to move quietly. After straining my eyes for a bit but able to discern nothing, I concluded that it was some kind of animal and moved on. The wind picked up while I was at my Grandparent's house, and when I was going back to my father with the gambling money, the bamboo bushes were too loud for me to hear anything of what was going on at the pond. I stayed with my father and his friends with an hour or so more, before starting on my way towards my grandparent's house again. The moon had lowered in the sky now, and the shadows had lengthened. I had to focus fully on the path before me as I walked. So I had not looked at the pond until I heard someone stepping on water. I looked towards the source of that sound and there she was. A woman sat cross-legged above the water. Her skin was white (pearl white, I think. This was a very long ago, and I'm only placing this in retrospect) and seemed to exude a pale white glow. Somehow like moonlight, but there was no way the moonlight reached her where she sat on the pond. Her hair, somehow darker than the shadows in the background, flowed weightlessly in the air. Her whole being seemed to be weightlessly floating above the water. Bobbing up and down slightly. I thought her eyes were closed but when I looked at them I realized that they were just the same white as her skin. And they were trained on me. So I ran. There wasn't anything in my hand, and by some miracle, I didn't stumble and fall even once. I ran all the way to my grandparent's house, crying and stuff. They asked me what happened and after some deliberation, I told them I saw a snake. As a ten year old, it was a bit too embarrassing to say that I saw a nude female ghost. I was laughed at for being that scared of snakes anyway, maybe I should've just told them what I saw. My father came back at around midnight, and he seemed to not see anything. My grandpa died in 2020, and afterwards, my grandma decided to drain the pond and fill it up. They found an old lock with some hair tied to it at the spot that I saw her. Maybe that's related. Anyway, that's my experience. What do you think of it? Have you experienced/heard of something similar? I'm excited to see how you interpret what happened.",Apparition On Water,Bangladesh,Apparitions / voices / touches,2024-07-09,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28389
23,Other,"""Você pagará pelo que fez."" (You will pay for what you did.) I heard a deep voice in my dream and woke up around 4am. I was begging for forgiveness the moment I woke up, but will then become conscious, and would wonder what really or who really did I talk or was with. I always forget what I have dreamt of but I remember that is the voice that always wakes me up and I feel that it is a linked dream... Somehow scary, somehow odd, somehow there are lots of fights and arguments. ""Heh... Was the dream in color?"" my friend asked me. I shook my head and answered, ""Nah, I don't really remember, do you dream continuous dreams like a continuation of a video?"" I asked my friend. She was very into dreams. Reading and her accuracy was not too bad, but don't misunderstand this because later this case is going to be a little weird. ""Is the whole dream in Portuguese?"" my friend asked. ""Yes, I mean...maybe? I don't remember... Are you going to read my dream? I got very little details"" I said in a way trying to stop my friend from talking about my dream. ""I feel that I can tell the meaning of the dream if you tell me more details!"" my friend fussed around still trying to ask about the details of my dream. Suddenly, I heard a voice from a distance ""...jamais..."" (Never ever... Or something like that) ""O que?"" (What?) I replied naturally. My friend stood there and looked at a direction, I looked the same direction and saw a shadow passed away. ""Did the shadow speak?"" I asked my friend. ""Eh? No... I mean... That just came out of you, right?"" she replied. I did not understand what happened, so I ignored that day and went out. I came back the evening and asked what really happened at that moment when both of us saw the ""shadow"". ""well, etto... That shadow I thought I saw it came out from your back"" she answered as if she was not too sure about it. ""Do you know anything about that?"" I asked. ""Remember the trip we went last week to Noboribetsu?"" she asked. Yes, we went to Noboribetsu to a place call the Jigoku-Dani, otherwise the Hell Valley. That place is not really what it sounded like or haunted, it is just a volcanic area full of hot springs and minerals, sulfuric gases and boiling hot water will still be seen around. Not too far away we saw a dead animal not sure what that was but it was helplessly dangling at a cliff (cliff? Or maybe it was a tall rock, not sure). Why did I bring up this trip here? That's because my friend believes that animals could curse people when they are in spiritual form. A very ""Japanese thought"", because traditionally Japanese thinks that haunting and cursing are categorized as the same. Not going to explain too much because this may mislead the story. ""Yes, I remember at the Hell Valley, we saw an animal dead dangling on a cliff, does the shadow you saw look similar?"" I asked in a way trying to to be both understanding and kind of skeptic. ""I think it's a bear, and you know, bear in Ainu Culture is..."" she tries to tell me as if she is sure what really happened. ""You will need to be a little more scientific, see? I am not trying to say that you are wrong but we were not bear hunting and it is not logical if the bear to be haunting or cursing me"" I said not letting her finish up her sentence. ""Ryuji, I know! But the shadow was huge and it is not a person, I saw it went out from your backside, it was shocking! If that was not a bear..."" she said in a tone as if she was very heated up and stopped at the middle of her sentence. ""What happened?"" I asked. She pointed back because there was a eared shadow right behind me. I smiled and said to her ""It's Aleshanee playing under the lamp"" we both laughed. From that day on after the shadow went out I did not dream of anything strange, and luckily nothing really bad happened. I am still kind of looking the answer for what that shadow really is and what the dreams really are about.

24,Other,"This is happened when I was in my post graduation and under training during the summer vacations. Due to extreme heat, my health became very bad and I remember I remained ill for 22 days. One day my supervisor saw me and said that your face is becoming blue like you are going to die any moment. I was not feeling well and one day in the evening, I was lying on my folding bed and my mother was ready to gone to Kirtan (the singing of prayers to god with a musical accompaniment) and told me to lock the door tightly, I told her ok but I was too weak to raise my hand so I didn't bother myself to lock the door and continue doing my work which is to sleep. I kept my face towards the wall while sleeping... After some time I felt as if someone had come to my bed. I felt like this because he was lying and his shoulder is touching with my shoulder, the space was so small for two on that bed that I have to move my hand. I felt like may be its my father or uncle, they often woke me up from my deep sleep during twilight time because in our house you are not allowed to sleep while twilight. Even though I was too weak still I opened my eyes a little and looked to the person shoulder and noticed he wore white clothes. I did not dare at all to ask who it was because I was feeling so sick and dizzy. I turned back facing the wall again and slept... After some time my body got in relax mode my arms in distress mode which was squeezed when the person lay down. It was like the person just woke up and give me the space. After some time, there was a knock at the door and I heard the sound of Papa's voice asking me to open the door, I just got up with sleepy eyes and dizzy head for opening the door. Then I remembered that I hadn't lock the door. When I saw my father's clothes, he was wearing a grey color kurta. I thought that may be it was my uncle like he came early from office and then left for some other work to do. After a few seconds, my mother came from the kirtan and shortly after my uncle came from the office. He wearing his uniform white shirt and I was relieved with the thought that it was my uncle. But when I asked him I found out that he just arrived and I was alone in the house this whole time. After few minutes everybody notices that my doggie named angel was not around and we were searching for her. She was hiding on one side of the store room and scared. I took her in my arms and comfort her. It took time but she got better... After that incident my health started getting better but until today I did not know whether it was God or Satan?...

25,Other,"These events took place in SE London, back in the 1980s. A long time ago, when I was dating my ex-husband, he was living in a dingy basement flat that was so damp a previous tenant had actually nailed the wallpaper to the wall! I was OK going there for the first couple of weeks, until I needed to go to the loo one lovely, sunny afternoon. I duly trotted upstairs to the (revolting) bathroom shared by all the tenants. So far, so good! Coming backdown I saw a man in a WWII ARP Wardens uniform looking out of the window at the back of the first floor of the house. For those who don't know what the ARP was, it was a group of very brave men and women who patrolled the streets at night (when most of the air raids took place) as Air Raid Precaution Wardens. Part of their job was to tell people whose blackout blinds/curtains were not totally lightproof to cover their windows (like Hodges in Dad's Army) and also to sound warnings and generally try to protect people when an air raid took place by getting them down into the public bomb shelters or into their own bomb shelters. This was all after doing a full day's work, as well! Anyway, I digress. My ARP warden was standing and looking out of the window at two children and their parents (the father was wearing a Royal Navy uniform) playing with a ball in the back garden. He was totally focused on the little family and then started shouting and banging on the window, trying to get the family to the safety of the Anderson shelter in the garden (this was an upside down U shape with a hole underneath it big enough to take the residents of the house and was made from corrugated iron supported by wooden supports and covered over with earth, where families often grew vegetables!). The warden turned around and went to the top of the stairs and promptly vanished, but I did hear footsteps running down the stairs very fast. When I looked out of the window, to see if he'd made it to the back garden, the family had vanished, and all was quiet in the garden. I saw them quite often after this and, of course, it piqued my interest about what had happened in the house. I went to the local library and into the local history department. There I found out that a bomb had landed on the house behind the house my ex was living in. The family had been killed by debris raining down on them and the subsequent fire. My ARP warden was also killed as he ran out of the house in an attempt to get the family into their air raid shelter. I found it very sad especially as the family in the garden were really enjoying their time together, possibly whilst the father was home on leave. I saw this played out three times in all and each time I felt tears welling up, knowing that all of them died - even now, remembering it after all this time, I still have tears in my eyes. This house threw up another 'something' but to stop this becoming War & Peace, I'll write about it in another post.

26,Other,"I decided to take some time away from traffic controlling with my best friend, whose name I am changing over to Heather. Heather and I have a platonic relationship. She's like a big sister to me. I've known her since I was 17, nearly forty years now, we've been very close. Heather has this fantastic wee mini-Foxy named Pippa (you know her from the old church in the woods, this is her) and the three us go adventuring. Anyway, it's about a month back, in June, cold as cold it can get where I live so we decided to take a week drive out over the Border Ranges, out towards Tenterfield - where Peter Allen is from... You must know who Peter Allen is...'Going to Rio'? Anyway, from where we were it was a good six and half hour drive, bar from the traffic controllers, some whom I knew, that held us up. We got into town about an hour later than we expected and stayed the night in one of the local pubs before setting out the next morning. It was late that morning when we found the old cemetery. It was run down, uncared for but still fascinating. I wondered why this was untended to since it wasn't that far off the beaten track, just an old dusty dirt road with partial opened land but mostly regenerated forest. We wandered around the old boneyard and saw some of the headstones were exposed to the weather that the names were erased but dated back to the very early 19th century, Pippa was having a ball sniffing this out this and now new smell. Most headstones were now overgrown from lantana and ivy, and lichen. We followed a path and found ourselves what looked to be a children section, judging by the headstones, which were small, and only had either a name or a year when that child died, mostly stillborn. It was here I suddenly felt a tug on my jacket, like someone was anxiously trying to get my attention. I turned but there was no one there. I walked on, and again, that tug on my coat. I again turned sharply, quick as I could but...nothing. Might've been the wind I hear you say but it wasn't windy enough to tug at my coat. This was a tug from a person. Like some child, perhaps, playing a game with me. Heather turned and looked at me. 'You right there?' 'Dunno...thought I...' then I noticed Pippa doing something odd, lying on her back, wagging her tail. 'Uh...Heather, what the f**k is Pippa doing?' She turned and saw the same thing. The dog was on her back, looking up at something (or someone) wagging her tail then quickly stood up, still wagging her tail excitedly and yapped, which she doesn't do normally. She looked over at Heather and I then looked about for whoever played with her belly but saw nothing. An idea suddenly occurred, well, more like an experiment, to see if she can detect anything for curious old me. I'm no ghost hunter nor am I interested in being one. But what I had here was a golden opportunity. Heather was against it at first when I told her. 'No effing way are you using Pippa for some effing fantasy you have with ghosts and goblins. No, I'm not effing letting Pippa to be involved.' She finally relented (because she realized that she had to walk back through the graveyard back to the car, which was a fair bit back) and decided to come along and see what happens. We followed Pippa along the now overgrown path, passed old, broken headstones and graves, doing her usual doggy thing when she suddenly came to a stop. She sat down before a small headstone. Heather went over and read out loud: 'I think her name is Ameila, hard to tell, but she was only seven years old when she died. 1867,' Heather looked up at me with tears in her eyes, 'such a short life. But why Pippa?' ""Why not? Perhaps she had a dog like her and used to rub bellies with. Who knows?' Pippa wagged her tail then Heather went looking for some flowers and soon came back with some Banksias and laid upon her grave. I took Pippa's collar off, placed it on the grave then we left.

27,Other,"On April 15, 2023, I entered my Stick Indians story here on YGS. Within 3 weeks of it popping back into my mind I sent the story here. I really had no idea 2 visions were going to break loose from my memory in a little over a year. In my stick Indians story this happened in 1990 alone in my cabin. I had a crazy loud rattle over my house encounter and then erased from my memory for 33 years. I asked my wife and my friend who lived in a trailer on the side of the cabin from 1992 and bought it from me and still lives there today and we worked together for over 10 years, and I had never mentioned it to him or my wife. WHAT? I stated in my Stick Indian story it may have lasted 10 minutes or more. I feel the fear and panic I was under it was probably a lot less time as I do not remember telling myself WOW I SURE AM GLAD THATS OVER WITH. I also know it was not a helicopter over my cabin looking out upstairs window 2 ft away no lights and no prop wash in my trees next to window. About 6 months after sharing Stick Indians here on YGS I had my first strange vision or recollection. I do not know how but all of a sudden, I am seeing a white triangle, and it is literally taking up all my vision area, really close to my face. It seems to be about 12x12x12 inches each side. I see 3 knob looking things in all 3 corners of this triangle, they are about 1 1/2 inches long and about 1/2 inch wide, round and look metal. It looks like a long roller bearing and seems to be less than 6 inches from my face. At the top point of triangle this knob is strait up and down. The lower rt hand corner knob is angled at 4 O'clock to the outside point and the inside of this knob is about 9 O'clock a slight angle, and the left corner knob is angled at 2 O'clock to the inside and 8 o'clock down in the corner area. I mentioned a metal sounding rhythmic rattle; it seemed 3 things were spinning together making this noise so now after months of this thing in my thoughts I have convinced myself that this is the noise maker and these 3 bearing looking things spin together at the same time and this is my troublemaker, this gadget took me out. I have mentally wasted too much time on this in my face white triangle, pyramid thing. The wife gives me the LOOK when I bring it up. My 2nd vision, recollection is around 6 to 8 months after the first vision. It seems I am standing on my own I cannot move my head only my eyes, looking straight ahead. I notice I am surrounded by low shine dull stainless, foil looking metal. Strait in front of me a metal wall 20 ft wide counting dark as night opening and around 25 ft or more away scanning left to right there is an amazing looking wall reinforcing pillar. It seems to be 14 inches wide at top ceiling area and it goes down and outwards following the wall to the floor and seems to be around 24 inches wide at the floor. It looks like whitish raw aluminum and bottom right of support maybe 4 inches away from the bottom of this pillar at the floor is a rounded start of end wall and next to opening as dark as night. AND THERE IT IS maybe 5 1/2 ft from the floor mounted in this pillar is my triangle. I can tell buy the pillar the floor is going away at the bottom and the top pillar is closer to me, it's a rounded wall. The ceiling walls and floor is the same metal color. Also there are no seams I can see except the wall to my right has a seam where wall meets ceiling. The wall to my right maybe 10 ft away that stops near the dark as night opening and I think opening is bigger than what I am seeing opening is maybe 7 ft wide. And it is floor to ceiling seem about 9 to 10 ft tall. Wall to my left is also maybe 8 to 10 ft from me and wall stops before outer rounded wall. I feel each end of the walls at their ends could be a walkway. There is decent light, but I don't see its source. There is a beautiful very light blue hue reflecting off the floor. I see no foot prints no dirt on floors or walls very sterile looking. There are no tables, gauges, levers, like on TV only the white triangle next to the dark exit. On July 24, 2024, we head to Washington for a graduation. I had arranged a regression session a week earlier at 9.30 am with a lady I used many years ago. After 1 1/2 hours we had no luck at all, but she did take a copy of the picture of my triangle. Now I feel it's time to share what has happened so far. By 12:30 this same day I am standing across the street from my old property in Shelton Washington. I hugged a big, beautiful cedar tree. I could only get my arms halfway around it and very thankful to be back here. I miss the cedars. I head across the street to my old cabin. Both brothers, my old friends are sitting at a table. My wife and myself both have covid right now and do not know it, I am hacking a little. I go out in the big flat yard looking for round dead area but do not notice anything. Luckily, they both did not laugh at me. UFOS are one thing Abductions are never discussed. On my way out I showed them my copy of the triangle I made, and I also went to the end of the road to show the family that had moved in 2 years later than me. She took a picture of the triangle. Somehow, I am going to get this out there, have some made and get them out in that area. Imagine how many hundreds if not thousands of people have seen this triangle on their way off this craft and then out of nowhere pop back in their heads years later like me. I do not feel happy by sharing this, it is just another odd thing that's happened to me taking up space in my mind, but this did happen and I have shared it. I feel it is the control panel for the outside ramp system. I am sending a picture of this triangle I made out of plastic and cabinet handles it's not perfect, but this is what I saw.",Abduction It Seems,United States,Misc,2024-08-16,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28419
28,Other,"This story, we're getting in the Way Back Machine and travelling back to the year 2015. It was about a week before my senior prom and I was going to make reservations at the local Olive Garden for me and my best friend. I got the normal greeting, ""Thank you for calling Olive Garden at ____. How can I help you?"" Now, I was 17 years old and a little nervous because I didn't even make my own doctor's appointments yet. I said ""Uhh... Hi. I'd like to make a dinner reservation?"" And I was then put on hold. I don't know how many of you have ever actually CALLED an Olive Garden, but there's usually really tacky Italian music playing when you're on hold. Not this time. Instead of music, there was this loud whistling sound, almost like wind whistling through a window screen during a rainstorm. I tried to listen because I swore I could hear words in with the whistling / swishing sound. And boy, oh boy, DID I HEAR WORDS. Mixed in with all of the swishing sounds, I heard a voice that sounded similar to Gollum from Lord of the Rings. I couldn't make out what was said at first and then I blatantly heard ""You're the WORST kind of cold."" I remember just feeling my insides freeze and then the wind sounds stopped and it switched to the Italian music. Within seconds, the host or whoever was going to take my reservation picked up and helped me out. With the way I dragged this out, it sounds like the whole ordeal was like... 5 minutes. In reality, it was probably 1.5 - 2 minutes. Easily one of the strangest things I've ever experienced. Ten years later, I can still hear the voice in my head.",I Just Wanted To Make A Reservation...?,United States,Apparitions / voices / touches,2024-08-20,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28423
29,Haunted Places,"After a long battle with Parkinson's related dementia and cancer, my Dad lost the fight in early July of this year. I had just visited with him a week before and he gave me no indication of knowing who I was. He became, quite literally, a shell of his former self. As his daughter it was very hard to watch. While I live in Arizona, and Dad lived in Massachusetts, what I'm about to relay happened while I was in Amsterdam. Two weeks after Dad passed, I was visiting Amsterdam. A year ago I had planned a trip to Europe, not realizing my Dad would be leaving right before that trip. At the urging of my family, I still took the trip. They convinced me it was what Dad would want me to still do. After all, he was a world traveler himself. During my final night in Amsterdam, I had fallen into a deep sleep, woke up once around 4am to use the bathroom, and then went right back to bed. I suddenly found myself standing at the edge of an old cobblestone bridge. I was waiting expectantly at the end for someone when suddenly a man came into view. He was surrounded by people of varying heights and ages. As he came closer, I could see the man in the center was my Dad. The people surrounding him were different versions of himself throughout his life. I saw Dad as a toddler, a teenager, a young man, a middle-aged man, and finally, an old man (which is what he was when he passed at 78). As he drew closer, all but the middle aged version of him and the old man version remained. The other images disappeared. The middle-aged version of Dad appeared healthy and happy. He smiled brightly when he saw me. The old man version remained in the back and did not acknowledge me at all or make eye contact. But the healthy, happy version of Dad seem to be lit from within. He gazed at me like someone who hadn't seen a loved one in a very long time. He embraced me and then gasped in what sounded like relief. Other than that, he didn't say a word. It was okay though. His smile said it all. I hugged him back and was happy to feel that he wasn't all bones like he was a few weeks prior. I could see the outfit he was wearing; gray mock turtleneck with a navy windbreaker, and jeans. I'm not sure why I remember that outfit. It's not something I recall him wearing in life. As quickly as it started, the dream was over. I knew when I woke up that this was no ordinary dream. This was a visitation. After leaving Amsterdam, I flew back to the Boston area for services. I let my sisters know of what I had dreamt and that I really felt Dad was alright. I relayed the event with tears in my eyes and could barely speak recounting it. My middle sister recently told me she dreamt of Dad too. He appeared, also middle-aged (when I believe he was the happiest) and healthy. He spoke to her but she couldn't remember what he said. My youngest sister is still hoping for a visitation as well and wondered if he chose to visit us in order of our ages. I really do hope she will be next on his list of visitations.

30,Other,"I am going to preface this story by stating that I'm not entirely sure what exactly happened to me, but based on other occurrences in my life and the experiences of others, I believe a supernatural element was involved. This past holiday weekend, something extraordinary, although for me, unexplainable happened. It's a long one, fair warning! To provide some additional context to what occurred, I should explain that anyone that knows me, knows I enjoy listening to the old Casey Kasem AT40 countdowns from the 70's & 80's. I have an online station that plays them non stop 24/7, alternating between the 2 decades. Every holiday during the summer from Memorial Day-Labor Day, the station plays a marathon of the year end countdowns from 1970-1987. This was during Casey Kasem's original time there (he left for various reasons in August of 1988 but returned to reboot AT40 in 1998) this station specifically played only the countdowns from that time period of 1970 (when the show originally started) to when Casey left in August of 1988. I had heard these marathons before and enjoyed them, the best of the best from that time period, and when they end with the year end countdown of 1987, they resume normal programming (various countdowns from the 70's & 80's) I had caught them on Memorial Day and July 4th, nothing unusual. This weekend was no different. I had just planned on enjoying an extended relaxing weekend after the crazy month I had and just listening to music, reading, napping, and having some good food. One thing to note, is lately, I had wondered what the countdowns sounded like when Casey rebooted the show, I hadn't heard them from 1998 on, because my music tastes were drawn more to the past and I wasn't aware of any local stations that broadcast AT40 at that time (internet replays weren't much of a thing during that period as the internet was still new). I had also been wondering about a certain Celine Dion song from the late 90's and how it placed. The weekend seemed to start off normal enough but on Sunday, I started to feel bizarre. I felt a sort of anticipatory energy, kind of like when you're patiently waiting for Christmas morning to arrive for presents etc. My body seemed to be on an alert awareness. I couldn't figure out why, there was nothing out of the ordinary that I was expecting (or so I thought). Either way it was disconcerting, the countdowns/music, actually helped keep me grounded, but I still felt adrift, if that makes any sense. It was unfamiliar territory, but at the same time, not alarming, just different. For some reason, I had this nagging feeling lately to clear pictures off the wall in my bedroom. Where some people have cluttered homes, I have cluttered walls. I love pictures and paintings, and have put so many of them up, some of my walls can look like collages. For some reason Sunday, I finally cleared most of that wall, just felt like it. The unusual feelings seemed to increase as night fell. I finally retired to the bedroom, to relax and watch TV. Around 9:30PM, things got interesting. Not to try for TMI but I suddenly started using the bathroom a lot, which was strange because it had been more than 4 hours since I had drank anything. I actually was starting to worry about dehydration, but I wasn't thirsty. This type of body behavior was abnormal to say the least. Around 10PM. I heard noises like wood cracking near the front door which ironically was on the other side of the wall I had cleared earlier. I've heard similar noises before, and attributed them to the house settling, but the sequence of noises was different somehow his time. Then I suddenly got a feeling of something being very off, not my physical senses, more like a psychic or inner knowing. There wasn't time to think anything because the lamp by my bed started flickering and it never does this. I've had power interruptions before but not like this, the TV was on and wasn't disturbed at all. The light was on the side of the bed closest to the wall I mentioned. I 'saw' something pass on the left side, but it was very unclear, (I'm not even sure I saw it physically) it was kind of like watching the heat rising off a sidewalk on a hot day. At the same time, as I was considering how out of character the light was acting and the sudden onset of odd feelings, (I was more curious than frightened) it happened! I felt an energy field/wave enter my body from the left side near my shoulder (at a close diagonal from the lamp) and move through my body and pass out my right side. Another crack of wood happened at the front door and everything seemed normal again except for the way I was feeling. I was wide awake, and too much had happened too fast. I didn't sense sentience from the energy, but there was definitely purpose. My rational mind was on overload and I think I went into a state of shock. Everything I picked up was from from my psychic/other senses and my mind couldn't explain it, so it dismissed the event. The next day, sleep helped restore some sense of balance, but things still felt off. I was resting more than usual, I hadn't slept as much as I'd like to, and had bizarre dreams that I couldn't fully recall, but I enjoyed listening to the music, it was soothing. Finally in mid afternoon, I happened to be listening to the year end countdown of 1987 as it ended. The commercial which announced the special they had been running all weekend long for all year end countdowns from 1970-1987 came on again and then it got bizarre again. There was a pause and a brief interruption and then new music and a new intro played instead of reverting back to the regular array of 70's/80's countdowns. Then the announcement came on that the year end countdown for 1998 was being broadcast! This had never happened before, the station up to now was specific for the original run of countdowns from 1970-1988! The commercial I just heard stated the marathon would end with the 1987 year end countdown, yet somehow they were playing the top 100 songs of 1998! What's more, Casey announced that that particular Celine Dion song I had wondered about would be in this countdown. 2 birds, one stone, the very things I had wondered about in an offhand way came to pass! I listened to the entire countdown, though it wasn't really my era, (I was worried if I turned it off, whatever I had been tapped into would end) and that experience was in of itself worthy of writing another post about, the effect it had on me! When it ended, the station reverted back to its previous lineup, I caught the next 2 countdowns just to check the air dates, and everything seemed normal or as expected at least. I have no explanation, but when I started listening to that new countdown, my memories from last night and the previous day came flooding back, like some kind of puzzle pieces being put together, as if it all was on hold until this event! Even clearing the wall, when I tried to think about that part of it, a phrase from that movie came into my mind ""Build it and they will come."" That made me laugh, but I've had trouble processing everything else, whatever it was did affect me and it was significant. I know that when the energy wave passed through me, I didn't get chills, it didn't feel negative, in fact it seemed more neutral than anything else. Whatever it was, seemed to pass through the front door at a slight diagonal, through the wall, the lamp and then me. Where it went, I'm not sure, I had a vague sense it moved to the opposite wall. A lot happened, very fast, but due to my alert/aware state and my natural curiosity I managed to mentally catalogue it. It didn't really start to hit me until Labor Day with that countdown. The lamp by the way is fine, no blown bulb, it's worked without a hitch since, just as it did before. I can only venture guesses as to what may have occurred, in time I'm sure it will be made known to me. Perhaps even the countdown thing can be explained, yet the timing with it and everything else cannot! I still feel it noteworthy to share as that came though for sure!",Labor Day Encounter,United States,Misc,2024-09-04,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28429
31,Haunted Places,"It was about five or six years ago, in 2018, when I was studying at an institute for my banking exams. I was staying in a hostel at the time, and one day, my parents came to visit me. They decided to take me to my maternal grandparents' house, which I was excited about. We arrived there in the evening. The next night, my dad told us we needed to visit a friend's house for a housewarming ceremony. It was going to be my first time there. We left at 7 o'clock in the evening. The road to my dad's friend's house was narrow with many turns. As we turned onto their street, we passed an abandoned house at the entrance. As we navigated the labyrinthine streets, we reached a turnoff and were greeted by an old, abandoned house at the entrance. The sight of it sent a shiver down my spine. As from childhood, I had always been fascinated by eerie, forsaken places - those lost in time and memory. I turned to my mom and asked, ""Do you know how long that house has been vacant?"" She told me to quiet down and not get lost in my imagination. Despite her words, I couldn't shake off the cold, eerie feeling that washed over me as we passed by. I heard a voice, cold and hollow, calling my name. I looked back, my heart racing, and saw a woman standing in front of the abandoned house. Her curly hair was unkempt, her clothes tattered and stained. Her eyes were fixed on us, piercing through the darkness. As soon as I opened the car door and stepped out, a chilling wind swept past my back, leaving me with goosebumps. That night, as soon as I went inside the house, I was struck by a severe headache and fever. I had been perfectly fine before this. Everyone was shocked by my sudden illness. The next morning, my family's faces were etched with a mix of horror and disbelief. When I asked what was wrong, they recounted the chilling events of the night before. Apparently, after we returned from the housewarming, I had retreated to bed, but my behavior became increasingly bizarre. I woke in the dead of night with wild eyes and disheveled hair, rocking back and forth as I muttered incoherently. They said my eyes were sunken and dark, my face gaunt and unrecognizable. They were terrified when I started to speak in a voice that wasn't my own, a voice that hissed, ""I couldn't get married. I want to eat meat; they killed me."" My words were laced with a malevolent energy, and I repeated them over and over until I collapsed, my body wracked with fever. When I heard about this, I rushed to the mirror. My face was pale, as though all the blood had drained from it. My eyes were hollow, and I looked utterly exhausted. My maternal grandfather arrived, and upon seeing me, he immediately asked, ""Who did you bring with you?"" He chanted ancient mantras, his voice resonating with a powerful authority. As he blew on my face, the heaviness lifted, and my body felt lighter, the fever subsiding almost instantly. He revealed that I had unknowingly brought negative energy with me. He revealed that I had unwittingly attracted a malevolent spirit, a dark entity that had tried to possess me. Fortunately, he was able to expel it before it could fully possess me. The experience left a lasting mark, a reminder of the thin veil that separates us from the unknown, and the chilling reminder that sometimes, our curiosity can lead us to the edge of darkness.","""whispers From The Abandoned House: The Haunting Of 2018""",India,Haunted places,2024-09-16,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28433
32,Other,"Today, the story which I am going to share with y'all is a bit scary and real experience which happened with me last year in 2023... The story revolves around my gym... First let me share the details of my gym- My gym has 3 floors- On ground floor, there is weight section, CrossFit section and reception (where you can do enquiry about the gym). On first floor, there is cardio section, terrace to do yoga and gym office (members not allowed). On second floor, there is another terrace which is rarely used to do workout like Pilates and Zumba. This incident revolves around the terrace of the second floor. I usually do workout in the CrossFit section. Now the incident goes as follows- It was 10 pm in the night. My elder sister, my trainer, 5 of my friends, and myself have decided to go to a place to party post-workout. The same day, I went to the 2nd floor terrace to see what was there as I have never seen that room before (As y'all know curiosity kills the cat). I saw it was a mid sized room and the floor was covered with green turf and there was a tap attached to a wall. I opened the tap to check whether water was flowing or not (the water was flowing). After checking the room, I was going down but suddenly I heard a banging sound from the rooftop of that terrace. The sound was not that loud but I heard it clearly. It came from some 1-1.5 meters away from me. Hearing that sound, I was bit afraid but I didn't think about it that much. As soon as I went down, I thought maybe I have left that tap open. My friends were waiting for me so I told them to wait until I check the tap and come back. I went to the second floor again but now I did not entered the room fully. I was only watching inside the room standing behind the door. Just as I was watching inside the room, that banging sound came again but this time it was very loud and it did not came from a distance, it came just above me on the roof... I was very shocked to hear that sound. I closed the door without checking the tap and went down quickly chanting Karpur Gauram Karunavtaram (Mantra of Lord Shiva) to relieve my fear. After this incident, I never went to that second floor again and I still don't know what was the source of that sound. Anyways, I hope y'all liked my story...

33,Other,"First of all to explain what Oni is. In legends or children's stories, Oni is an imaginary human-like monster. It is said to have horns on its head, naked and wearing a loincloth made of tiger skin, and to be monstrous and wild in nature. Oni are often imagined as monstrous creatures, but they can also appear as spiritual beings in some religions. The true identity of Oni as a spirit is human being, a him/her self. It is said that a person will become an evil spirit due to hatred and jealousy, and will transform into a form of demon, the Oni. Very famous Noh play, performs Hanya, starting as a beautiful woman and slowly transforms into a horned monstrous being because of her anger and jealousy against her lover. Since they can be spirits, Oni is regarded as a form of fear that brings disasters to people in the same way as demons in western cultures (I am kind of more familiar with demons than Oni). This story does not really evolve on a person changing into a demon, but rather watching a person being cursed by the Oni. From the previous story (may be a couple of stories before since I have rushed my posts during the summer) my friend's family were believed to be cursed and were not able to go to Kyoto area freely due to political problems dating back centuries ago. ""Ryujin?""my friend called to me. ""Yea? You want some snacks again?"" I called back, I was in the kitchen cooking some paste sauce to keep and some for us to use. Also my friend was in her period, so she needed random snacking and munching but not too much since her stomach is weak. She ran in the kitchen carrying our ""baby"", Aleshanee (actually my house cat) and began, ""my cousin just sent me a message through Line (a Korean app which looks kind of like WhatsApp), saying that his family members are in trouble."" Aleshanee was doing a ""what?"" face and that made me smile a bit. ""I am not joking! Please be in the mood to think it as something paranormal!"" she fussed and pulled me over to see her phone. ""Alright so... Someone got scratched? And... What happened?"" I asked looking at a picture she was showing me. ""That's my cousin, he was scratched mysteriously, you know he does not have any pets? And he lives alone, and you know that scratching mark if he would have been doing it himself it would not be like that"" she pointed out as many strange evidence as possible and tried to make me think of something paranormal related... That always happens and I always will debunk her ""evidences"". Always, I told her every scientific possibilities, ""sleep disorder"", ""imaginative-victimization"", etc (Almost everything I heard here in this site and something else I learnt from other people). She insisted those were not the fact, and will blame it something else much more complicated. ""Alright, what about demon possession?"" I answered losing my words. ""Hey? You know what maybe it is kind of close? You know our family is cursed,"" she told me toning down a little. OK, this always happens during our ""normal"" conversation, she will pick-up something about her family's curse, and blame all kinds of possible facts... Alright respect the legend so and so... GOT IT, GOT IT. I jumped a little because there were no changes for 1 week and so, I was camping and was a little drunk, I did not really remember the conversation, but I got all the messages inside Line. My friend sent me a message ""Ryujin, my cousin's wound became worse."" ""What can I do? Call a doctor,"" I replied. My friend called, I barely remember what she said, and it was about some sort of curse, so I think I became a bit cranky and just cut off her call in the middle of the conversation. ""Why did you cut me off?"" I saw my friend's last message in the morning. Spooky for me because I still do not remember any conversation there, but that is not the main case. Re-reading the messages in Line, and looking at my friend's cousin wound on his arm, it reminded be of a bear, for those of you familiar, you know how they leave scratch marks on trees? That is how the wound looked like, three non-perfect lines deep at one end and lighter at the other end. I asked my friend ""did your cousin go to the wild and get attacked by some sort of wild animal? I know it's a very odd question to ask someone who lives in a big city."" My friend sighed and answered, ""Well, no. But that wound, at first it started to be a burn mark, than it became itchy, than he scratched until the itch is gone, than it swelled and became the claw like mark, than a scratch."" It seemed to me an infection but I do not know how and why the wound will deepen itself with no reason, perhaps it is some kind of strange bacteria? (Someone with knowledge, help me.) What really freaked me out is that her cousin would call her middle of the night, explaining how the wound is... Like he will say that his wound would still bleed, it is always wet, things like that. BUT, he will never visit any doctors or go to the hospital. I am not sure this long story, is even paranormal. But if it is some sort of possession, will it be better to go visit him directly and bring him to a hospital? (I am planning to visit him with my friend though). And, yes, this is still going on and it seems that he will start to have fever every night but will be cured in the morning.

34,Haunted Places,"I am back to share after a while. I have been rather silent, just reading. I would like to share a personal experience with you all. This happened soon after my mum passed away in 2014. It was a rather sudden passing as she had been sick but not to the point where we thought we would lose her. My mum was a real fighter. She had suffered a stroke in 1996 and lost the use of her left hand completely, however she learned to live with her disability and mastered the art of cooking, washing and cleaning with just 1 hand. We were not the best of friends; however, she was my go-to person whenever I was lost. She always knew how to deal with any situation. When she passed away, it left a huge void in my life. I began suffering with PTSD. It was not easy, it took time, but I eventually got over it. I missed her so much and would speak to her all the time. Sometimes I used to just feel a warmth come over, and I knew it was her way of telling me she was there. After a while I used to to get the most beautiful scent. It used to only last a few seconds. I cannot describe what it was, it was not perfume or incense, but it would just pass me by and be gone in seconds. A few months after she passed, it was my dad's birthday and we had a little braai (South African term for a barbeque) for him. I joked with my dad and my husband earlier in the day that my mum will be there. The air was filled with the smoke of the meat and sausages being braaied, but my husband swears to this day that he got a beautiful scent, amidst the smoke-filled air. A few months passed and my dad once said that he was alone thinking of my mum and he got a strong scent around him. There was nobody at home. I was the only female and I also do not wear floral scented perfumes. I say floral because it is the only way to describe it however, it is something unlike any other scent. This has happened to me several times in the last 10 years. It was not easy, but now when I do think of it I think it was my mum's way of telling me that she was close by. My dad has since passed away. It has been 6 years. He too sends me signs, but that is for another day. I welcome your comments and your take on this. Please advise if any of you have had any similar experiences.

35,Haunted Places,"I am back. Just at work, not so busy and I decided to share an experience I had after my mum passed away. As per my previous experience, I did share that my mum was obviously trying to be there for me after she was gone. This I found a little strange and would love to know your thoughts. So here it goes. Mum passed in January 2014. She was not really well leading up to her passing, but she always did her own cooking, washing and cleaning. She and dad lived in the main building, and I lived with my family in our little 1 roomed granny cottage. We would often cook and share our meals as my dad would often eat with my children. She knew I hated herbs and would never dare to send me some. I still remember the day she cooked it, and we laughed about how I said I would rather die than eat herbs. I remember putting it into the freezer so she and my dad could have the leftover food another day. Approximately a month after her passing, my colleague and I were having lunch, and she said to me that she dreamt of my late mum the night before. She said that my mum was all jovial and told her to please advise me to take out the container with cooked herbs from the freezer, if not it will lie there until she is born again. I actually spilt my tea all over my clothing that day. I was shocked beyond words. Only I had known this not even my dad, let alone a colleague. She only saw my mum from afar on the day of her funeral. My colleague even described the container it was in. My colleague was no psychic or mind reader, just an ordinary girl. I got home that afternoon from work, and the first thing I did was go to the freezer. Lo and behold, right there in front of me was the container. I just stood there a while and stared into space. I defrosted the food and fed it to the birds by placing it under a tree. It had been there more than a month. If she was still there it would have been eaten. I no longer find these things strange as I have come to terms that our loved ones are always there even when they are no longer physically present. An update: I now love herbs, and my husband often jokes about me eating grass (that is what he calls it) I miss my parents dearly, but I know that wherever my mum is she is having a good laugh at me as I am still living and loving the herbs.

36,Haunted Places,"Just to keep it simple, I will narrate the story in chronology. During their final years, my grandparents were forced to vacate their own home and live with us (home owned by my dad). Actually all of sudden my uncle staying in a village came up with his entire belongings and his family to my grandparents' home. They eventually started torturing my grandparents mentally, who finally had to come and live with us. My dad used to take care of grandparents as if they are this kids, like changing their diapers, bathing them, feeding them. My mom used to cook food for them and I and my siblings used to clean their room. Both of my grandparents were very much satisfied with our love and care. Indeed this is what all parents expect in their final days. Days went on and one day, my grandpa expired when he was 95+. Couple of years after my grandpa's demise, my elder brother got married, now along with us my sister-in-law also used to take care of my grandma. After few months my grandma also passed away due to old age. My dad used to miss his parents like anything. Maybe it was his secret desire to have them back in our lives. Few years later, my elder brother and sister-in-law were blessed with twins (a girl and a boy). It is very common in India to name kids after grandparents or ancestors. In memory of my grandma, we named the girl by picking first 3 letters of my grandma's name. The kids grew happily and the fact of the matter is they both never knew anything about my grandparents as we didn't speak much about them. But don't know why, my niece used to sit in same way my grandma used to sit on floor. My grandma used to kill the ants with her bare fingers and my niece also got that habit. Like this, she inherited few more attributes from my grandma. The main incidence happened when the kids were 5 years old. That day, my dad was upset for reasons unknown and refused to eat. We all requested and insisted him to eat but to no avail. All of sudden, miraculously, my niece came to him and talked same words like my grandma but in her own voice. She said ""hey Ashok, eat!"" All of us were shocked. It was the feeling of grandma's soul into my niece body. It was exactly how my grandma used to say. Hearing this my dad's mood lit up. He said my mom came back to care for me and then he had dinner happily. After this incidence, my niece never talked like that or imitated my grandma. Till now not sure what made my niece talk something beyond her way, addressing her grandpa with his name (in India out of respect, young one's never address elders by their name). She used to address my dad as ""Baba"" always. To make the point clear, we all heard it and I clearly know my niece never ever knew how my grandma used to talk and that incidence never happened again in our lives.",Suddenly My Niece Talked Like My Grandma,India,Haunted places,2024-11-11,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28457
37,Other,"When I was around 8 or 9, on weekends we'd gather on the sofa and stay up until midnight watching TV shows. At the end of the shows, they'd play the national anthem, indicating that no more shows were airing for the night. My father would then wake my siblings and me to move to our bedrooms. Before heading to bed, we need to use the bathroom for a quick pee. However, I was too scared to go to the bathroom at night because it was dark, and there were a few steps from the sofa to the kitchen, and then to the bathroom. So, I decided to pee outside near the doorstep where the lights were on. It felt safer because I could still see my parents inside the house. I was sleepy, and as I looked around where we parked our car, behind it was our Sari-Sari Store. Above the store, stood a huge watery rose apple tree that had been there since my grandparents got married. As I gazed up at the roof, I saw what looked like ""figures"" that seemed human. As I focused, I realized it was a huge dark-coloured man, sitting on a tree branch, and swinging his right leg, almost like he was just chilling there. I froze in shock, recognizing him as a ""Kapre,"" a creature from Filipino folklore. Terrified, I rushed inside while peeing my pants. My parents asked why I was so scared, but I couldn't explain. I couldn't believe I'd seen something I thought was just a story. As I near 30, I still wonder if it was real or just a sleepy illusion. But I know what I saw that night.

38,Other,"Incident # 1: When I was in college, my uncle told me something that happened when I was around 6 years old. One night, he and his friends were drinking inside our compound. He went out to buy cigarettes, and as he returned, he saw me running down the street toward our gate. Suddenly, I was hit by a taxi. He yelled at the taxi driver, then panicked and rushed to tell my parents, but they were confused. My father told him he might have been drunk and explained that I had been asleep on the couch. However, my uncle was terrified and convinced he had seen my doppelganger. Incident # 2: One day, my sister and I were talking about ghosts. She told me she had seen my doppelganger. After returning from church, she went to the kitchen and out of nowhere, saw me walking toward my room. She asked me questions, and I nodded in response. A few minutes later, when she went to my room to check, it was empty. To her shock, she had received a message from me an hour earlier saying I wouldn't be home until next week. Incident # 3: It was late at night when my friends and I were hanging out outside our house. Two of my friends were passing by and stopped to say hello. As we continued talking and laughing, those same ""two friends"" returned and told us they had just seen me on the way to the store to buy something. They were confused and asked how I had gotten back so quickly when they had just seen me heading toward the store where they had just come from.

39,Haunted Places,"Hey! This just happened a few days back (20/01/25) and having my brother as a witness makes things a bit easier. We like bushwalking so we go up behind the big dam and explore the bush for a few hours. We would find great stuff up there but also it's a strange place. Then come back for a beer or two and a game of cards. Normally we do this with an old mate but sadly that old friend passed away just before Christmas. This day my brother and I were playing a game what we call Twos and Fours (not going through the rules but it is an easy game to play and very competitive). We sat there, laughing and having a great game when we noticed that there was an extra set of cards lying on the table. That was odd for I would've seen the cards sitting there but they just... Oddly appeared. That was the first time. We shook our heads and assumed we must've dealt out an extra hand without knowing. The second game we were into it and finished when we found, again, a set of cards sitting there. Again, I would've seen them. I counted them and they came up seven, the number of cards you need to play the game. Though it was a hot day, we both suddenly felt cold. I have no explanation. I cannot get my head around it. I am used to having weird shiat happen, but this was strange for my brother saw it, too, and he'd seen ghosts himself (strange family I come from-most of my brothers seen ghosts or had some weird shiat happen). I'm not looking for any help, just want to share this strange experience.

40,Other,""" HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE? SOMETHING SO REAL, SO TANGILBLE, YET IMPOSSIBLE? I HAVE. AND IT HAPPEND AT THE GLASS DOOR."" It was a usual day in college, I had my exam which was over by 11am. I just wanted to go home quickly and sleep. I looked at my friend she was still writing so I thought I will go and wait for her near the reception area. My exam was at second floor, there are four stairs but only one stair end near the reception I decided to take that stair. To reach the reception we had to go through two glass doors. One glass door is near the stair. I opened that door and stepped in, behind me was the lift. That area is always cold maybe because of air conditioner or maybe because its near the basement. As I was about to reach the second glass door I saw a guy at a distance coming; he was tall, wearing a casual outfit blue jeans and white shirt. I didn't open the door and stepped back. My brain told me to keep walking, but my body refused to move, to let him go first. He looked at me and he smiled weirdly. He held the door bar with his left hand and opened halfway through and suddenly he was not there. The glass door was halfway opened. The glass door moved Not because of the wind. Not because of a faulty hinge. And I thought maybe I was hallucinating but the glass door opening with the wind is rubbish. And I know what I had seen every single detail. I was shocked and curious at the same time. What I think is maybe... Maybe the glass door is sort of a portal because they are facing each other and the fact the lift has mirror too. Maybe the figure was passing by and I somehow saw it but I am 100 percent sure it was not my hallucination.

41,Haunted Places,"""Caramba! Cobra com corpo de fogo!"" (Wow! Snake with a body of fire) My grandmother shouted from far away. I was on my way back from my grandfather's place, I just ran as quickly as I can to my grandmother and hugged her tight. I had phobias of both snakes and fire and ghostly stuff... My grandmother will usually use them as a threat so that I had a reason to hug her. ""Avó!"" (Grandma!) I shouted at my grandmother nearly crying. My grandmother will just hug me tight and laugh. That was one little scene that will pop into my mind as a sweet memory with my grandmother. My grandmother will make-up monster hybrids made out of my phobia other than this ""famous"" fire-snake, there were snort-spider, dead-tree-dog, later when I was older spooky tall-man in suit, zombie-mailman, etc... (sound like some ghosts from ghost busters? I think she got the idea from the show too lol.) My grandmother died when I turned teenager. I did not go to her funeral because I am afraid of dead bodies too. How ironic that she became one of my phobias, dead body and lost the chance for me to hug her... I thought during that period of my time. Yes, I did have a dream and my grandmother was there but I am not going to go deep with that, in the dream my grandmother shouted ""Caramba! Homem morto com membros quebrados!"" (Wow! Dead men with broken limbs!) as usual I will run up to her and hug her but I stopped right in front of her.""espera... Um homem morto? Eu pensei que você tinha ido embora, avó?"" (wait... A dead man? I thought you are gone, grandmother?) she smiled with a kind look and gently hugged me in a warm way. And that was it. The next day I remember that my family got a call from the grave dealer, back in those days cremation was not that popular. The dealer came to us and said that they had to sell part of the grave yard. (yes, I was told that always will happen back in those days) I had a tingly feeling that I had to go to my grandmother's grave. At the end we needed to dig up my grandmother and cremate her. Yes, I hold my fear and saw the whole scene of digging up her grave and sending her to the crematorium place. I followed the whole time and saw my grandmother for the last time. She was as if in her deep sleep, a tear lingered on my face and I finally could say my final good bye to her. Later that time what I remember is that the graveyard literally just shrank its size into half, many unknown graves and graves with nobody to claim were left destroyed... This time my grandmother's lie (dead men with broken limbs) kind of became real and I nearly missed a chance to say my final good bye. I know this is more of a dream than an experience but if considering this as an experience with my grandmother, do you think that she knew that the graveyard was going to be sold?

42,Other,"One night I was putting my chickens away, locking them up so they would not get attacked. I was alone, waiting for my other sibling to get out there with a flashlight so we could look for eggs together. I was locking all the little doors on the coop when I heard a soft whistle to the left. This wasn't rare, since we have houses surrounding ours, but when I looked away from the direction where I had heard it, it whistled again. I again, just shrugged it off, thinking that it was someone just calling their dog home. But then the third time I looked away, it whooshed up to my ear, making it seem like someone was right there in my ear, whistling. I quickly spun my head to the left, where I had heard it, but there was nothing there. I glanced warily around, but couldn't see anything that could have done that. Finally, my sibling came out and we hurriedly checked for the eggs, and went back into the house. I told them and they just seemed creeped out, but also kind of joyful at my obvious discomfort. I don't really know if it was a boy trying to catch my attention and the wind caught it or what. We are surrounded by mountains so it could have just echoed, but I am not sure. It really could have been anything, but I was pretty creeped out in the moment. So... Maybe it was just an echo. It was coming from a kind of put off, creepy, rundown place though. Well, nothing else like that has happened to me since. I want to say it was around a year ago, maybe more, maybe less.

43,Haunted Places,"This happened two years ago. The year 2023 etched a considerable mark on my family and me forever. 18th December 2023 was the day my grandpa ascended to the heavens. Let me give a background. He was 81, had a sturdy demeanor, was religious, and was an astrologer (a real one). On the evening of Dec 10, my daughter and I waved goodbye to him after meeting for a while. He waved back too with a warm smile, lest we knew it would be the last meeting of 3 generations together. Nothing in it is haunting, but tragic. His Death: He went to purchase some medicines on the morning of 10 December. He lost consciousness and slipped from the stairs. He fell with such force that his skull faced internal injuries, causing intracranial hemorrhage. His jaw suffered a minor fracture as well, due to which he was not able to speak in his last moments. My mother, brother, and cousin rushed to his aid after receiving a call from a noble individual. He was admitted to a hospital nearby. On the way, he was trying to speak but couldn't say anything. Upon arrival, he was put on a life support system. The treatment lasted for 48 hours, and then he was medically monitored for potential revival. The medical fraternity did everything to revive him, but at 11:45 pm, Dec 18, he breathed his last. Hearing this news, we were shattered to the core. Though we were mentally prepared to see him slowly drifting away on the other side, you can understand how it feels to be helpless at such a moment. Later that night, he was brought home, sleeping in the lap of eternity, with peace on his face. I & my brother held ourselves strong. Cremation & Remaining Rituals: In Hinduism, we cremate the dead by burning them. It is believed that the soul merges in 5 elements (air, earth, water, fire, and space). The same night, my brother dreamt of him. My family was sitting, and my grandpa was there, looking at his kin and smiling. The post-mourning rituals last for 13 days. In between, my birthday came (X-mas day), and my grandpa wasn't here. I dreamt of him where he was hale & hearty- came to wish me- and vanished (I'm in tears while writing this). During this week, my family saw the dead grandpa in their dreams. Eventually, this slowed down. Now, we see him sometimes in our dreams. Looks like he's protecting his kin from the unseen danger, talks to us as if he misses us too, and makes his divine presence felt. I'll always cherish every moment spent with him. May God bless his soul. Love you, Grandpa.",He Misses Us Too,India,Haunted places,2025-04-03,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28506
44,Other,"Just over a month ago, my friend nearly died and I was fully convinced they were dead until they were confirmed living a few days later, so you can imagine just how bad my mental state was at the time this happened. I was an absolute wreck. I usually go to the graveyard to walk around, calm my thoughts, reconnect with nature and just overall tighten a few loose screws in my brain when they want to come undone, so I decided to go for a walk to help get my thoughts in order. It was my sanctuary. And for the most part, it worked. But when I went into the graveyard that day, it was different. I broke down a few times because my friend's favourite song came on over my headphones, and I spent a lot of the walk just overall being sad. At one point I sat by the foot of a tree and just started crying for a while. But that's not actually the paranormal bit I want to talk about. This happened a little bit later when I accidentally came across a part of the graveyard I hadn't seen before. It was fenced off from the rest of the graveyard and seemed to be slightly more full of graves than the area around it. There were a few paths inside the fenced off area that all seemed to lead to this massive mausoleum in the centre. It was completely shut and looked like nobody had used it in years. I went over to investigate and I saw there were these statues of angels that lined the top of the mausoleum, and most of them were looking outwards towards the rest of the graveyard. But one was looking directly downwards from the roof. Looking directly at me. I couldn't look away from it. It stared at me. I stared back. I tried so hard to look away but I just couldn't. It stared at me with eyes full of hate and malice and unforgiving coldness. Those eyes were more than just stone. I don't know how to describe it. At some point I dropped to my knees. The floor was cold and wet and uncomfortable but I couldn't move. I could only look back into it's eyes. And I swear that behind the eyes of that statue was something so much greater than anything we could comprehend. There was a soul in that statue. Inside that statue is what truly looks over this universe. Not some Christian god or a god from any other religion, but what truly observes and watches over all the world. And it does not like what it sees. At some point I began to scream. I began to scream at the statue and I asked it why. Why it would do this to me. Why it would out so much suffering and unforgiving into a world so originally beautiful. I asked it why it would hurt my friends, why it would cause them so much pain. I was angry. I was so very angry at this cold and unforgiving being because it has caused all the pain and suffering ever inflicted on those I love, and it has caused at the pain of the universe as we know it now. And it just stared at me with more judgement than I have ever known. Then something inside me snapped. Something snapped and I just ran and ran and ran as far away from this horrible, malevolent being as fast as I could. I threw myself over the fence and ran blindly down the dirt paths until one of them led to an exit. But as I ran, I could feel every single angle statue I passed staring at my back, watching me and judging me and hating me for my existence. I ran all the way to my house and the entire time I couldn't shake the feeling I was being watched. Please help me. Two more incidents like this have happened to me between this happening and me reporting it now (that I've also submitted to this site). I haven't gone back to the graveyard. I still sometimes feel like I'm being watched.

45,Haunted Places,"This story comes from my dad, who told me this when I was 12, I was highly interested in anything paranormal and although this probably pales in comparison to other stories on here, I think it's still interesting considering it happened after a funeral. This takes place before I or my brother was born. Just to set the scene, it's an apartment on the bottom level with a side door that is the main entrance, but it has two floors. Anyway, my mom and dad were coming home from my grandpa's funeral, and as they were unlocking the door they heard a lot of footsteps from the second floor. My mom and dad looked at each other and quickly unlocked the door and ran in. They searched the whole place, 1st and 2nd floor found nothing. Nothing was disturbed. No one in the house. The only alive thing in the house at the time was the cat, and my dad says it distinctly sounded like footsteps. My mom, who's never really believed in ghosts, told me it was the cat knocking stuff over (though according to my dad nothing was touched or out of order) and my dad likes to entertain the idea it was my grandpa visiting them one last time. I personally like my dad's version, but I wasn't there and I technically got two versions of the story. My mom looked at the situation reasonably and with most logic, however because they were coming home from the funeral I like to believe my grandfather was doing a final walk-through.

46,Other,"YGS family, today I am going to share an experience which took place in July 2002. I had just given birth to my eldest son. He was only a month old. It was icy cold winter. My baby had been awake and crying since about 9pm that night, nothing seemed to help him. No massage or pacifier or milk. I was a young mum, tired and exhausted, I walked all over the room that night trying to soothe him. At approximately 3.15 am I went to my little brother and asked him to go downstairs and warm up my baby's milk. As he left my room with the bottle, my baby went stiff in my arms and his eyes rolled white. I panicked and ran into my parents' room. As I went into their room, I heard something fall and I heard my brother screaming. He came upstairs into my parent's room with the milk bottle in his hand. He was trembling. In the meantime, whilst he was catching his breath my dad jumped out of bed and asked him what had happened. This is what he had to say: As he walked downstairs, he peeked into the lounge, and the heater was on the floor. Next to the heater was a creature that looked like a black cat but also a human. Its eyes glowed similar to a cat in the dark. He just said it looked at him, kicked the heater down and just flew into thin air. My dad went downstairs immediately armed with a pocketknife, tuned on all the lights, and there was nothing. No open or broken doors or windows, nothing in any corner of our lounge and dining room or the kitchen. He even went as far as checking all the cupboards. Nothing. Sweet nothing. My mum and I began chanting and praying and after about 5 minutes my baby was normal again. He had his milk and slept. Now personally I have not seen this demon, so I cannot describe it. South African folklore would suggest that it was something we refer to as a tokoloshe. A demon entity sent to trouble people. So by now many of you would know that there was an entity in our home, but this was definitely not that entity, because our resident entity was really harmless to all of us at home. It literally left after my mum passed. If there are other South African readers here, please read and comment. To everyone else please feel free to comment. I also need to mention that I have not experienced any strange occurrences since 2014. My home is actually very light and airy and we feel the positive vibes. Thank you for reading.

47,Other,"Introduction: Since I was a kid, I was well aware of the existence of angels and guardian angels alike. It was something I accepted without question, though I never spent much time wondering who my guardian angel might be. But as the years passed, I had experiences-moments that made me question what else might be out there. Some were fleeting, a chill in the air or a whisper of something unseen. Others were undeniable, encounters that left me shaken and searching for answers. I never expected all of it to lead me to one presence in particular. But looking back, I realize the signs were always there, waiting for me to notice. These moments didn't feel connected at the time. Each experience stood on its own, unexplained and surprisingly - intriguing. Early Encounters: Ever since I was a kid, I had various paranormal experiences - though not too many. One of my earliest occurred when I was six years old, when I witnessed what I now believe was my mother astral projecting. It happened in the house I grew up in, located in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. I was lying in bed, wide awake, when I suddenly saw a ghostly vision of my mother floating through the hallway. Freaked out, I called out to her. To my surprise, she answered from the next bedroom, reassuring me that everything was okay and that she knew what was happening. Three years later, in the same house, I had another encounter. I was lying in my bed when I saw a shadowy figure walk from our front door to the kitchen. It was an odd situation, due to the fact I never the door open or close, nor did I hear footsteps on the creaky floor. The next day, I asked my parents if either of had been up during the night. They both said no. The Viking Vision: For years after that, I don't recall any major experiences - though it's possible I had more but dismissed them, as I was skeptical about ghosts. But in 2008, at 31 years old, something happened that made me rethink everything. I was at a friend's house in Westminster, Colorado. He claimed his house was haunted, so I decided to play ghost hunter. I asked the usual questions: ""If you're in this room now, give us a sign."" Sure enough, we heard tapping. On another night, we kept hearing similar taps, so another friend took out his camera to snap a picture from where the sounds were coming. What appeared in the photo shocked me - a ghostly image of a man wearing Viking attire, smiling directly at the camera. Riverdale Road: Riverdale Road in Thornton, Colorado, is notorious for its hauntings. It's only about 10 to 15 minutes from my house, and over the years, I've had several strange experiences there. The first time I went was around Halloween in 2008. A group of us drove down the road, trying to find the infamous tree where supposed witch hangings had taken place. Along the way, a dirty pickup truck started following us - it felt straight out of a horror movie. When we finally found the tree and pulled over, the truck drove past us. We got out and stood by the tree for about 20-30 minutes. It was eerie. Near the tree was a dirt road leading to an old dairy farm, and it was easy to imagine accused witches being led down that path toward their fate. As we stood there, we suddenly heard girls laughing - not distant, but close. Off to the side was a small ditch, and near it, we kept seeing the figure of a woman in a white dress appear and disappear. My friends were spooked and wanted to leave, but I was curious and wanted to stay. Since I was the driver, we left. That night, after I got home, I heard a strange clicking sound in my car as I turned it off. Strangely, that clicking sound continued intermittently for the next eight years - until I got rid of the car in 2016. We went back the next night, but this time, nothing much happened. The only odd thing was a continuous, unidentifiable sound coming from the tree itself. A couple of nights later, another friend and I returned. This time, we were curious enough to drive closer to the dairy farm. As we did, we saw a ghostly image of a man floating toward us - wearing an apron and holding up a knife. We turned around and got out of there fast. The last time I had an encounter on Riverdale Road was in 2009. We got lost trying to find the tree, and as we searched, a car suddenly sped up behind us, passed, then vanished into the darkness. We finally found the tree, got out for a bit, then drove farther down the road. As we did, a shadowy figure crossed in front of us. That was enough. We turned around and left. Haunting at the Stanley Hotel: In 2013, for our honeymoon, my wife and I stayed at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado - famous for inspiring Stephen King's ""The Shining."" Every time I took a shower there; I got the eerie feeling that I was being watched. One night, I was lying on my stomach in bed when I felt a pressure on my back - like someone pushing down on me. I quickly turned over to see if it was my wife, but she was turned the other way, sound asleep. We also took a ghost tour at the hotel. One story that stood out was about a maid who had died in a fire. Legend has it that she haunts the hotel and tries to break up couples she doesn't believe are properly married. I couldn't shake the feeling that she might have been the one bothering me. In the hotel's old music hall, we were taken to a basement where people had supposedly experienced hauntings. One room had belonged to a man with mental health issues, and each time we entered, we had to announce ourselves. The energy in that room was heavily, uncomfortable. Across the hall was a room where a runaway girl named Lucy had died in a fire in 1969. One of her ghostly habits was shutting the door on visitors. I was skeptical at first, thinking maybe the door was spring-loaded. But then, as I was walking into the room, the door began to close on its own - then suddenly stopped, as if allowing me to enter. A Guardian Revealed?: For years, these experiences stayed with me, but I never thought of them as anything more than isolated events. But then, something happened that was different from all the others. This wasn't a passing ghost or an unexplained chill in the air - this was something deeper. Something that stayed. In 2022, I reached out to two mediums to try to contact my deceased parents. Both experiences felt successful. No Ouija boards, no tarot cards - just a direct connection. During the second session, something unexpected happened. I connected with a third person. A person whom is known by the public, with a familiar face. Before my second medium experience in 2022, something happened that made me feel like I was being guided to bring up this particular person. My wife and I had taken a trip to Arizona, and on the way, I noticed a billboard with this person's picture on it. Something about it drew me in, but I didn't think too much of it at the time. One day, while walking through downtown Scottsdale, we passed an art studio. In the window was a painting of this person. It caught my attention, and I felt a deeper pull, but I still wasn't sure why. Then, as we continued our travels and headed to Farmington, New Mexico, I saw another billboard with this person's picture-this time in a different location, but it was the same image as the first one. That was it. Three different images of this person in three different locations. It felt like more than coincidence. That's when I knew-I had to bring her up in the medium session. Looking back, those moments feel like pieces of a larger puzzle, guiding me toward something I was meant to explore. Whether it was fate, faith, or something beyond explanation, I can't ignore the way this person's presence made itself known before that experience. And maybe, in some way, she was leading me to a deeper understanding of the connection I was about to uncover. It all started in July 1998. I had never understood why, but after my mother passed away in 1998, I suddenly became fascinated with this person. It didn't make sense - I was 21 years old and had known of this person all my life. Yet, out of nowhere, I saw a picture of her. A picture of her in a way that the public wasn't used to, and something clicked. I was drawn to her in a way I couldn't explain. Even my father found it odd. Over the years, I've had numerous dreams featuring her. In one, she appeared as she looked in the picture that drew me to her. It didn't quite look like her, yet my brain registered it as her. In another, I was walking when I saw her. Words were exchanged, though I can't remember who spoke, but I distinctly heard, ""See you later."" I woke up, fell back asleep, and sure enough, I saw her again. Twice. In August 2022, I had a dream where I was telling a friend about something random. As I spoke, she appeared behind them. I told my friend to turn around, but by the time they did, she was fading away. Then, suddenly, she was in front of me - again, as she looked in the picture. We talked, and before the dream ended, she hugged me. The hug felt real. The medium I spoke with believed I connect with this person through God. Another person I talked to, someone knowledgeable about ghosts, suggested she could be my guardian angel. A few months later, I had randomly searched for guardian angels online. One site claimed your guardian angel is linked to your birthdate. When I clicked mine, an image popped up - a blonde woman in a red dress. I thought to myself, was this something I was meant to see? As I had mentioned, this person is a familiar face that people know. A person who was born in the 1920's, and passed in the 1960's. The person I'm referring to is - Marilyn Monroe. Or rather, Norma Jeane. That's what I prefer to call her. During my session with the medium, as I was talking about Norma Jeane, something behind me fell. I turned to look, but nothing seemed out of place. It didn't feel like a scare tactic - just a simple hello, I see you. From 2022 and into the present I started seeing her more--not just in dreams, but through pictures, in places I never expected. Maybe she was always there, and I just wasn't looking. The Court Case: In April of last year, I was pulled over by a police officer while coming home from running errands. I use marijuana for my epilepsy, anxiety, and ADD, and at that moment, I had my weed pen on me. Just minutes before being pulled over, I had taken a quick puff from the pen. When the officer asked me when the last time I smoked was, I told him honestly that it had been the night before, which was true. But I didn't mention that I had just used my pen moments before being stopped. I wasn't overly concerned about it, thinking that a single puff from my pen wouldn't affect me too much. However, I knew that I could've gotten into trouble, considering the circumstances. I had to pull up my insurance info from my phone, and as I was doing so, the officer asked me to move my car to the other side of the roundabout. I complied and continued accessing my insurance information. It was then that something strange happened. Earlier that day, I had been scrolling through photos of Norma Jeane on my phone. I've always had an admiration for her, and have a photo shrine of her that I was showing a friend. But as I looked down at my phone to finish pulling up my insurance, a photo of Norma Jeane appeared out of nowhere, as if it had randomly replaced whatever I had been looking at. I quickly closed it, thinking it was a glitch, but the moment stuck with me. It felt like more than just a coincidence - like something beyond the ordinary was at play. Days before my court hearing in May, I had a vivid dream where Norma Jeane posed for photographs in a red dress. In the dream, I stood next to her, put my arm around her, and we took a picture together. After the photo, she turned toward me and smiled. It felt so real, like I had connected with her on a deeper level. It was a reminder that there was something larger guiding me through this uncertain time. When my trial came around, the outcome was a relief - my case was dismissed. Looking back, I can't help but think that the moments leading up to the court date weren't just random events. The photo of Norma Jeane on my phone, the dream, and the strange feeling that she was somehow watching over me - it all felt like a sign. With everything I had going against me, from the weed pen to the circumstances of the stop, I don't think I was just lucky. I think I was blessed. Some might call it crazy, but to me, it's as if Norma Jeane was watching out for me, guiding me through one of the most nerve-wracking moments of my life. Auras, Coincidence or Not?: Going on topic about my epilepsy, there were two moments of my life that I experienced auras (a pre-seizure) in interesting places. It was moments like these, that made me think a bit, about what was the meaning of this? In 2007, I had to opportunity to visit Norma Jeane's crypt. I also visited the Roosevelt Hotel and the infamous mirror that was in the room at the time when Norma Jeane resided. I took a few pictures of the mirror. Across the hall was a gift shop with a picture of Norma Jeane on the wall in the back of the shop. Some of the photos captured that picture, and it appears to be glowing. Going back to topic regarding my epilepsy. While at Norma Jeane's crypt, I went on my knees and prayed silently. As I was doing this, I felt an aura coming on. I quickly rose up to try and shake it off. It went away after about 15 seconds. It was not too dramatic. At the time, I didn't think anything about it. Fast forward to 2022. I lived in Colorado for most of my life. Around Christmas 1996, a horrific murder took place in a house located in Boulder Colorado. A 6-year old girl named JonBenet Ramsey was brutally murdered. To this day, the case is considered a cold case. Everyone from the parents to the older brother were considered suspects. On a cold December day in 2022, I was running an errand in Boulder. Decided to make a pit stop and go by the Ramsey house. First time seeing it in my life. As I mentioned, I lived in Colorado most of my life, as I am a native. At first I drove around it to the back alley. As I was driving in through the alley I started getting a very eerie feeling. I made my way to the front again, and finally took a picture. I then left to head back home. On my way back home, I started getting an aura. I had to pull over for a minute to shake it off. It lasted for about 15 seconds, and again, not too dramatic. Weeks after that happened I think about that moment; as well at the time at Norma Jeane's crypt. Was it a coincidence that these aura's occurred during moments of visiting a cemetery, and a house where a murder took place? I can't explain it. Conclusion: I believe that in some way, Norma Jeane was guiding me, looking out for me. The coincidences and strange events - the dreams, the photographs, the subtle moments - felt like more than random occurrences. It was as though there was a force, a connection that went beyond logic, helping me navigate my life when I needed it most. Whether it was my faith, her presence, or something deeper at play, I can't deny that something beyond the ordinary was guiding me. Through the ups and downs, through moments of doubt and uncertainty, I've learned to trust the signs and listen to the whispers that come from the unseen. Maybe this was always the way it was meant to be. And in the end, I realize that all the pieces - every fleeting moment, every connection, every encounter - were leading me to this understanding. I am not alone. I am being watched over, guided, and protected by something greater than myself. Whatever it is, I'm listening, and I'm grateful for the connection that has given me the strength to move forward.","Beyond The Known: Things Unseen, Things Unknown",United States,Misc,2025-04-26,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28517
48,Other,"This is a sad story, so get some tissue while reading. It took me awhile to have permission from Aya's uncle, to put this story up. So, here we go. Buchi and my friend's aunt, Emiko, met around 2007. For almost 18 years, Emiko was so in love with Buchi, and I guess Buchi also loved his only human mum Emiko very much. When me and my friend visits Emiko will alway serve us Uji Green Tea (said to be the finest Green tea around) and cookies from a cat lover's store called Cacao Cat (no don't feed cats chocolate its toxic for them). I love their Almond Chocolates. Buchi will watch us finish up the cookies as if he was just listening to our conversation. Emiko will always smile at him and say,""you're going to have some goodies too, but now we have guests in our house, be polite my sweet boy"" and deep pat Buchi on his back. We always feel warm and happy watching the two loving each other. Last year, Aya, my friend received a news from her uncle, Hiroshi, that Emiko fainted on the way back home from the vegetable store around evening time, luckily there were some other housewives around, she was carried to the hospital by a local doctor to do a full body check. It was pancreatic cancer. Emiko spent weeks in the hospital treating the cancer, she have a chance to go back home but she could hardly walk because of the pain. We had to push her by the wheel chair because of her weight. Buchi somehow understood what was going on by his looks. First, he was sniffing the wheel chair. Emiko tried to pick Buchi up but could not bend her back because of the pain. But Buchi knew or understood that Emiko was in pain, so it jumped up on her lap, looked into her eyes and mewed ""Ah... My sweet boy...yes, I am in pain and I wanted to touch you, how did you know what I am thinking?"" Emiko hugged Buchi and we saw that there's tears in her eyes. Aya said that she had to stay over to help Hiroshi, I thought to head back home so that I will not disturb them but Hiroshi told me to stay over as well. So I stayed and slept at the coach. Buchi used to stick around me when I am around but that night Buchi was looking up the night skies as if he was praying for Emiko. I whispered his name but only his ears turned to me. I smiled and prayed as well hoping that Emiko will get well soon. A few days later Emiko needed to go back to the hospital for some emergency issue. It happened really quick. When we headed there Emiko was unconscious but when Buchi came to her she whispered. ""Buchi, my sweet boy, I will bring you along OK? Don't you worry, mummy is always with you..."" Buchi was very jumpy and needed Emiko's last hug but it did not happen. The 3 of us were left home with Buchi. We can tell that Buchi was really upset, he is slow that day and did not really socialize with us. We stayed over again that night. The next day Hiroshi was packing some sweet peaches to bring it to the hospital for Emiko. I was getting ready to go to the hospital too, I saw Buchi looking up the sky like the night when I saw him ""praying"" this time I kind of heard him mewing as if he was on the lap of Emiko, and I think I saw some tears in his eyes, I sensed something not right. The telephone in the house rang and Hiroshi picked up the phone. It was from the hospital... Emiko is going, I thought. We rushed to the hospital, I thought to bring Buchi along but Japanese hospitals do not allow pets... So we rushed to the hospital, humans only. Hiroshi went in the room, the doctor whispered some words to him. Emiko is gone... Lots had gone quite fast, calling relatives, casket ordering, booking funeral, etc... After the funeral, we went back to their home. Buchi was asleep on his favorite cushion? He did not move... Buchi was gone too. Did Emiko bring Buchi along to the other side as she promised? 1 extra question for cat lovers around, can cats cry like we do? This experience is far most the saddest in my life... I hope Emiko's pain is gone and Buchi is happy with his only human mother on the other side.",Did I See A Cat Crying?,Japan,Pets / animals,2025-04-30,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28518
49,Haunted Places,"Hey everyone, it's been a while since I've submitted my first story. But I'm back with another spooky experience. I will keep it as short and simple as possible. My mom and aunt live with me. I stay over at my boyfriend's house a lot so I'm rarely here. The current time right now is 3:51am. Yesterday evening, my mom told me she heard a tapping sound coming from our living room and then our room. She described the sound as water dripping on the air conditioner. I notice that it gets lower and louder again. But not too loud. But she pointed at the ceiling which was weird. I asked her if she thinks it was the neighbors upstairs and she said she didn't hear their footsteps. My mom is very good at spotting their footsteps at night because it's not hard to miss. She said she first heard it in the living room and then our room so it made me question if it was the air conditioner, she did point at the ceiling which tells me that's where she heard the sound coming from. I woke up around 3am and had been hearing the tapping sound for myself. I wonder if it was happening while I was sleeping or started happening once I woke up. I'm a light sleeper so I would've noticed the tapping sound before even fully waking up. It didn't sound as if it were already happening, it started about 2 minutes after I woke up. Well that's when I noticed it. I'm not sure. I don't feel like I woke up because I heard something, but I wonder what woke me up. Why is it happening since I woke up? Is it something trying to get my attention? I wonder if I stayed sleeping would it have started again. I was too scared to open my eyes at first. I'm still scared and think it may be something paranormal.",Tapping Noise,United States,Haunted places,2025-05-08,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28520
50,Other,"It is with a heavy heart that I type this today. The last month was traumatic for us as a family, we had to lay our beautiful fur baby Ciara to rest, after her heart failed her. She had been a bit bloated for a week and assuming she ingested something, we gave her laxatives and dewormed her. Nothing helped and as a last resort we took her to the local SPCA. She was examined and we were advised that there was nothing more that could have been done for her. My husband and I were forced to make a decision to end her suffering. We spent our last few moments with her. We were shattered as we didn't know if we did the right thing. Part of us felt as though we had robbed her of a life as she was only 8 months old. On the flip side we saved our baby as she had been suffering, she could not walk and was panting for breath. The water had filled up in her and she looked like a balloon waiting to be burst. We held her and comforted and she took her last breath. Her eyes were not closed, and the vet said to me that she was not a sinner hence her eyes were open. I did not know what to make of it. As I stood over her, I said a silent prayer, her soul should rest and my baby should be pain free. After a few days, I was picking up my dry washing from the line on the side of my house. All my other babies were indoors as it was cold. They were spread out in front of the heater on their blanket in my lounge. So, as I picked a shirt off the line, I see a black dog whoosh pass me. I looked again and there was nobody there. I went to my lounge and counted them all. 6 fur babies fast asleep. I go back outside and again the dog whooshed pass me. I picked my head up and said"" Ciara is that you?"" Just like that there was a warm breeze that I felt only where I was standing. I am not sure what it was and what it meant, but the feeling I got was just a warmth. To me it felt like she was there trying to tell me she was ok. I just wish I had a few more years with her.

51,Other,"My friend's father is a very emotional person. When he is angry, he becomes red, very loud, short temper (emotional?)... But never will he rise a hand to hit his family. I was once with my friend and her family in the middle of a conversation. Her father was asking her mother if she can hand him some salt, her mother just asked if the food was bland, and he became a little emotional and left the table... Well, information from her mother and my friend is that he is the type of person which will let the emotion out first then will come and apologize... I kind of noticed that, because that night I saw him going back to the silent dinning table and finished up what he had left over... I was like, calm down daddy... Calm down... Oh, there he is. (hahaha) Why did I bring this normal life thing up? It is because this normal life thing is going to be a process of the production of what I think is called a living spirit. We went to Hakodate for a week for a break, me, Aya and her parents. So Aya's father is an emotional person, he was complaining for a few times inside the cheap plane that Aya booked for all of us. I was able to stop 1 or 2 of his complaints but he was unstoppable, he did not like the kids behind us because he was kicking his seat all the time. He went cranky and got a warning from the pilot. Poor kids, they had to watch a cranky old man being warned by the pilot. Well, we arrived in time to the hot spring hotel, I see a smile on the cranky man's face. I feel that all of us were relieved... I tried to open up a positive conversation about this trip but Aya's father keeps going back to the things that happened on the plane. ""Alright, if that bothered you that much I will send them a complaint report, how about that?"" I finally could not take all the negging of the old man. Aya's father became quiet, her mother whispered to him and he tried to calm himself down. ""Let's check-in first OK? It's a tiring trip. Aya, can you kindly take your parents to sit over there while I check-in?"" I asked my friend politely. It took a while since the queue was long, about... 30 minutes I think? Oh, yes, I could see the red face of Aya's father. Aya was right beside him trying to explain but tell you what? Aya's father never would shout at me, maybe because I am not a Japanese? I do not know, but we never argued. We had to go to the dinner hall for our dinner since we arrived quite late, Aya's father did not feel well and so he had to skip his dinner. 1 man and 2 women sat together, did not really talk but ate quietly. Maybe, everyone was tired. After the slow dinner, I went to the Onsen space, I saw Aya's father from the far end of my sight, I thought he went to bath first because of tiredness. I did not really want to talk to him and so I remained quiet. The next moment I lost sight of him but I thought he went back to his room and did not care much. After the bath, me and Aya went to the lobby bar and talked for a while her mother came over too and joined the conversation, hoping to ask me some more questions about how is life with Aya... (Well, we are living together now but, we both needed time...so, oh, too much info, sorry...). I asked if Aya's father had a good bath, her mother replied ""No, we took the shower in our room. He is asleep now and I guess he will bathe during morning."" I thought I saw him at the Onsen space but it seems that it was not him? OK... Then my friend told me about the living spirit theory... Which they call ikiryo in Japanese. Does any one know about it? Like, if a person is too worried about another person or have strong will (or too emotional) against something that they really want to do, their spirit will get out of their body and go to that location to do their ""job"", but the negative part of this is, the person themselves will not notice it but will be very tired. It sounded like what she told me had just happened, but from some extra researches that I did the living spirits will not be able to go in to places that the person themselves did not go before. From my information this hot spring hotel is new and there is no way that her father would go there alone before hand. Did I see a doppelgänger of her father or did I just see someone else or... What did I see? The story continues; the next day I went to the Onsen space again and Aya's father was on his way there alone. Normally he will rely on a simple map that he can pick for free in the lobby, but he did not have any of that, so I asked ""Hi, I thought you will be looking at the map on the way."" ""Well, tell you what? This hotel is new, but it seems like I have been here before long ago or is the concept just right for an old man like me? Well, I can guide the 3 of you if there is chance,"" he replied jokingly. He showed me where the lockers are and he showed me where the resting spot is which I did not see the night before. It seems that he knew the place well... Hmm... Did he sneak out alone? So, do you think that there are possibilities that Aya's father let his spirit out because of the emotions and the very stressful day? Or did I just simply see a person whom looked like him or a doppelgänger? Also, does anyone know about the living spirit thingy or something similar?",Living Spirit Or A Doppelgänger,Japan,Misc,2025-05-15,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28524
52,Haunted Places,"First let me explain why I have gone to such place. You all know that I have been here quite long, well you can almost guess how old I am, maybe?（What am I even trying to say?） I mean age does not matter whether or not you visit haunted places, some go to have some chilling experience, have fun sometimes? (Which I do not recommend...) I visit those places not to have fun... I explore and will pray for victims if there were any cases happened historical or not (I will buy flowers and put it at the place if allowed and not bothered at all). I will not be specific about where this place is since the location is so small and easy to guess. Oh, by the way, it is at Okinawa so you might read about local myths. So where do I start... Last week I went to Okinawa alone to meet the local Yuta that I mentioned a few stories before hand about the Yuta trying to give a message to my father half the world apart from my long passed away grandmother... I think it was nearly 1 year ago?... Anyone still remember that? No, you don't need to go back to that story, this is a completely different event. So I met up with the Yuta, I call her Ume-san (I think she is in her 70s but she looks younger than that). She bowed deeply as if she met a very close friend and smiled brightly showing her silver tooth. ""How is your friend? I thought she will be coming along! She is such a nice woman, I wanted to talk to talk to her,"" Ume-san said in local accented Japanese which was hard for me to understand that I needed her to explain word by word to me. ""Ha... Explaining in ordinary Japanese is tiring, you need to come over more and speak more with me."" She said jokingly. I was still scratching my head from the local accent... Sounded like a Japanese poetry or a Haiku or... Something too traditional... Ume brought me to a country-side traditional inn nearby the sea-side. ""It's beautiful"" I said to Ume-san. ""This inn is the only inn the typhoon never will destroy. It has been here since I was practicing to become a Yuta. I know the owner, but he is gone now..."" Ume-san said. I can see loneliness from her eyes as she seeks over the ocean. ""How long ago was it when you practice to become a Yuta?"" I asked Ume-san. ""I was 13, the islands were still occupied by the Americans. My teacher needed to sneak in the forbidden forests during night time. She told me that there used to have a shrine, a shine with no priest, but full of gods and holy beings..."" she went on and I guess I was too tired to try to understand what she was talking about... I just nodded off the conversation (sorry, didn't meant to be rude). Ume-san said that she is living nearby so we can meet anytime, this trip was actually arranged by her. My friend Aya told me that she received her letter during March time and replied her that we will be going to visit her this year, unfortunately Aya had to deal with some family problem and so this trip became my lonely trip visiting the Yuta. Ume-san said that she wanted to bring us to the once holy ground. First Aya mentioned that Ume-san wanted to give the spirits which is protecting us a break time... Like energy charging or something?... Like some people will put power stones in some sort of special salt to regain its power? I still don't know if it was something like that... But please read on. At the evening Ume-san said that she is taking me to a local steak house... I told her that I am a vegetarian and she said that they don't serve meat (so, it was a vegan steak house? I am still not sure since I see people eating chunks of beef there...hmm...). The waiter there knew that Ume-san does not eat meats too, she ordered steamed vegetables and some fries. ""Charge the energy of the earth, eat some potatoes, Native Americans were energetic because they eat lots of potatoes"" Ume-san said and poured the plate of fries on my plate. ""Wow, Ume-san that's a lot!"" I said. ""It's for your spirits, you ever share any thing with them?"" She asked as she ate. I shook my head and started to eat the fries and the mashed potato on my side, I thought I was nearly becoming a potato myself... (oof...) That night Ume-san brought me to an area where it was said to be a holy ground... But we needed to go through wild trees, it was damp and very dark... And why during night times? She said she know the ways better during dark hours than I remember that she said she used to sneak in such places during night time... Oh, that is why. Ume-san says as we go ""so, Ryujin-san, your spirits around you seems to be still very active."" I was following her through the bushes and barely can speak but I said ""eish..."", which meant yes (mixed in different languages), lol. Ume-san slides down a slop with mosses and slippery grasses. I followed by hugging the trees and grabbing the plants around. ""Here, you recognize this place?"" Ume-san said eagerly and wiped some sweat off her forehead. I did not even know where we are heading and so I did not answer her at all. ""It's the XXXXX the famous haunting spot. We are right inside it where no one knows that it is this spot which is haunted, urban legends says that its outside where the cave is but the cave was just used as an emergency hospital during the war, nothing special."" So Ume-san just said that the place where we are is the place well known to be haunted, but I did not sense anything at all. Ume-san sat on a mossy rock in the cross legs position (the meditation posture?) ""Ryujin-san, I used to practice on this stone here when I was still a trainee, not to mention could I sense any ghosts. I did not even see any people back on those days."" Ume-san told me as if she was inside her own room or something. I did not know what to say and so I just stood there. ""Ryujin-san! Can you excuse the being behind you?"" shouted Ume-san. I was so tired that I just listen to her and thought nothing and moved to the left hand side. Ume-san came near me and patted my right shoulder and said ""wrong side... He just went past your shoulder... You should be fine, usually people get possessed that way."" Ume-san chanted a prayer and patted my back this time ""Done!"" She said smiling. I still do not understand why this silent dark forest is said to be haunted, so I asked ""why is this place the most haunted?"" Ume-san smile and sat back on the rock and asked ""Do you still not understand?"" Well, indeed, because haunted place are supposed to be full of paranormal activities right? I don't hear voices, I don't see a thing and I don't feel a thing, I thought to myself. ""This is a holy place for gifted people, for us Yuta, it's a place to regain power. For a normal person, it's just another dark forest, but for spirits it is a place to rest"" Ume-san said slowly and used simplest word so that I can understand too. I nodded, Ume-san brought me to a broken tree ""this tree was bombed by the Americans but they were not able to win the great spirits here. This place was once considered as a dangerous place by them, well who told them to attack the shrine, what a foolish thing to do, but you see, like this tree here the place never died,"" she pointed at the new leaves from in-between the broken trunk. It was amazing to know that the bombing did not kill the tree at all and that even today new life is forming. For a moment I thought I saw a few fireflies fly from the corner of my eyes but the moment I want to focus the see them I lost sight of them. Ume-san smiled and bowed just like last time when she was talking to the ""beings"" around me. I am not sure if this can be considered as an experience but what I want to say here is not every haunted spots are evil and dangerous in spiritual way.",Core Of A S Ranked Haunted Spot,Japan,Haunted places,2025-05-29,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28525
53,Haunted Places,"This incident happened in 2015. We have a house in South Goa which is not too far from Majorda beach at a place called Nuvem. South Goa as you know is less touristy than its northern counterpart and still retains its old world charm to some extent. Our house is 3 kms away from the beach and we have to pass through a lonely stretch of road just 1.5 kms from the beach. It is dark and mostly deserted after 7.30 pm. Normally we avoid this crossing this stretch on foot after dark. However, one day, my wife and I got a bit carried away with our evening walk on Majorda beach that we forgot how dark it had suddenly become. We were already tired and slowly began our walk back home. On this deserted stretch of land, lies a dilapidated house which we passed almost daily. Didn't see anyone inside, ever. Didn't think much about it either. However that night when we passed the house, a strange thing happened. As it is, the ambience was a bit spooky with paddy fields on both sides with no streetlights. It was then, for the first time I noticed a light inside the dilapidated house & just as we passed by, I saw a beautiful woman step outside. Definitely someone who would attract a second glance from the opposite sex. She was wearing a simple yet elegant salwar kameez. To my surprise, she smiled at me and gave a naughty smile which made my heart flutter. Too bad for me, my wife was around 😁. Just then something strange happened, my wife seemed to be disturbed, she grabbed my hand tightly and asked me to walk quickly away from the place as soon as possible. Upon reaching some habitation, I was sure that I would get some verbal lashing from my better half for ogling at a beautiful stranger. However what she said baffles me to this day. She told me the reason why she grabbed my hand and led me away from the place was because she saw a old man with a deformed face step out of the house and wave at her, beckoning her to come inside. This was exactly at the same moment I saw the lady who smiled at me. When I told her my side of the tale, she grew pale and nearly had a panic attack. After calming her down, I consoled her by telling her that, it was due to god's grace that we had escaped from the place unscathed and were back within the safe confines of our home. We decided the incident is behind us and move on. We never ventured down that path on foot ever again. The house has long been demolished and a building has come up in its place. Not sure whether the new residents have experienced any strange occurrences.

54,Other,"A couple of days ago, I was with my cousin squad and we were discussing some spooky experiences when I recalled one. So here's a haunting that remains unexplained to me and my uncle. This incident happened in 2009 in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Allow me to give a quick backstory. The Backstory I and my uncle went to attend a wedding in Darkot, a secluded & serene hamlet in Pithoragarh. I clearly remember the date: 15 Oct 2009. Since it was the first time for me to be a part of the wedding on the rural side, I was quite excited. In the villages of Uttarakhand, people tend to wrap up their day before dusk slithers. Generally, the celebrations were done in broad daylight and nights were peaceful. One night before the wedding, we were sitting in the yard with bonfire and enjoying the view of clear skies and mighty Himalayas right in front of us. The Entity Darkot, being a hamlet, has widespread greenery and trees. It was around 12:15 in the night when I noticed a shimmering white silhouette roaming in the lane. I tried to ignore but couldn't take my eyes off it. It was an all-white female silhouette, as if it was basking in the moonlight from within. My eyes were glued as it remained insight for 5-6 minutes. My uncle also saw the figure glide swiftly from left to right, like someone is strolling aimlessly. Both of us were overwhelmed with shock and fear. We collected our senses and rushed indoors. The Explanation We Got: We narrated this next morning to a house elder who gave an explanation in context to the sighting. He said that the entity could've been an angel, devatma (saintly soul), or a fairy. Such sightings in the hamlets and villages are common in Uttarakhand. Since it was shining in all white indicated it has harmless, but going close to it may have led to unwelcoming occurrences. Also, it was stated that the bonfire kept that entity away from us. We attended the wedding and flew back home. Even now while I type, I'm having jitters on both my legs. I strongly believe that there's a lot which remains unexplained from the human sanity, reasoning, and logic---something that we refer to as paranormal or supernatural, for a reason.",Shining White Silhouette,India,Apparitions / voices / touches,2025-06-03,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28535
55,Other,"I will tell you a story about an apartment we rented in Napindan Taguig. There were multiple hair raising incidents. This started way back 2016 when a lot of killings happened because of Tokhang. We were forced to Move to Napindan Taguig because my father was a well known pusher and drug addict at our place in Pasig. I fear for my family's safety that is why we rented an apartment in Napindan Taguig. It is a 100 square meter 2 storey apartment that has 2 rooms on the second floor. The rent was for only 5000 pesos which is cheap and a good deal, or so we thought. The apartment we rented is built at the end of a road that is why they call it Tumbok which is considered as unlucky and attracts bad energy based on Feng-Shui. At first we lived peacefully at our new apartment, but when they renovated the lot behind our house which has a lot of trees and flatten the land to give way to new residential lots. This is when the haunting began. My Daughter Mavis, was 3 years old at that time. As a typical toddler she is playful and we often see her playing by herself which is normal at her age. One day, as she was playing outside we asked her to come in because we need to go to a doctor's appointment that day. She said, ""Daddy, ayaw ko umalis magagalit si Mica mag lalaro pa daw kami"", ""Daddy I don't want to go, Mica will get mad because we are still playing"". Me and my wife got looked at each other stunned with disbelief. My wife asked, anak sino si Mica? ""Who is Mica?"" My daughter pointed outside and said, ""sya si Mica sya yung kalaro ko."" ""she is Mica she is my playmate"". Every hair on my body raised and I felt like my head is getting bigger because of fear when I heard what my daughter said. I immediately took Mavis and went upstairs and talked to my wife. We didn't see the entity but this was just the beginning.",Tumbok My Daughter's Playmate,Philippines,Children who see spirits,2025-06-03,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28536
56,Other,"From the title some of you can already guess that this ""Blue Boy"" seems to be the same spirit or being that I will encounter. When I was in Brazil he used to appear in the shopping mall that I used to go. I had never seen him anywhere else especially now since I am half the world away. Well to say the truth, I sometimes will notice that something is watching me. Not saying that it is the Blue Boy, like sometimes I will see things at the corner of my eyes and sometimes I will even sense touches when there is nothing. Oh, and I was reading my old stories here I even saw a boy in blue and he was the one helping me to take my wallet back. Somehow, that being when it appeared was in blue. Alright, done with the long intro. Long story short I met the blue figure again (Or is it another being?). This time nearby; my own garden. Why in my garden and why blue? No idea. So I was drinking some yerba maté with my friend outside one sunny afternoon. My cat, Aleshanee, was on my friend's lap snoozing, wagging her tail. Suddenly Aleshanee got up, ears straight forward and alerted. We thought that it was the postman, we looked over to the front gate but saw no one. Aleshanee went back in the house stretching her back on the way. I went in the kitchen and got some more biscuits and cheese, then I saw a shadow at the corner of my left eye. ""Again..."" I thought, yes, previously I see things nearby my kitchen area. (Shadows, monsters, etc) For that my friend did take me to the doctor checking my eyes, psychological checks, etc, I am normal so no worries for me. Oh, the doctor did ask me about having stress and lack of sleep and things... But hey, I am not stressed or sleepy. So I went back outside and Aya asked me if I was OK (She always thinks that me going to the kitchen taking sometime means I had something) ""No, just the shadow that I always see, not a monster this time so don't pull me over to watch kids' show"" I laughed and kind of shook it off. Aya went back in the house. Aleshanee was looking at Aya as if she was chased and started to show her belly ready for a fight. Aya watched her and smiled at her ""Silly, no time for that"" Aya smiled and went in the kitchen. As I was munching on the biscuits, I realize that there is a short man (?) standing across from our house. I thought it was our neighbor (who lives miles away from us) Aya popped out from the kitchen window and asked, if I know that person, I shook my head. I lost sight of that man but Aya said that she still see the man but he is now nearby our house. ""Did he walk?"" I asked. ""No, the moment I saw him he was near our front door"" Aya said. I was confused because I could not see him at all. I took everything in the house thinking that it was getting dark. The moment I glanced at the kitchen I saw a person in blue very clearly. ""Aya?"" I called my friend. ""Yes?"" She popped out from the kitchen door. ""Did you see a person in blue?"" I asked. ""No? Don't scare me please, you know I hate it when I am trying to cook here"" Aya replied defensively. ""Ryujin? Did you say in blue?"" Aya asked from the kitchen after a long moment. I walked in the kitchen and Aya was pointing out the window. ""That?"" Aya froze as she was asking. ""Yes, but wait, I don't think he is bad"" I hold Aya's shoulders tried to calm her down. She knows about the ""blue boy"" because I have been talking about it a couple of times, but she would kind of ignore it since she thinks that I was trying to scare her. ""Remember the blue boy?"" I asked her, she looked at me showing that not-now-face but then she understood what is going on. ""Ah, the chicken coop!"" Aya, suddenly remembered, I followed her to the coop and saw that we have a small trouble. There was a snake at the corner of the coop. Since polish chickens are bigger then ordinary ones, the snake did not attack any of the chickens yet, and there were still no small chicks yet since it is just starting to become warm, our chickens don't mate during winter time for some reason, oh, the hens will lay eggs though even if it snows. I went close to the snake and made sure that there were no chickens around, the snake seemed to be little weak? Or did it hibernate in the coop and just woke up? I picked it up with my gardening gloves and released it to the bush nearby. ""Ryujin, I was going to tell you that I saw this snake but I forgotten"" Aya said, as usual... Yes, she will for get the important part and fuss on else that's not too important. Anyhow, we got rid of the snake and secure the coop with barbwires to prevent snakes again, of course we did a final check to see if there were any other snakes hidden. I also checked outside to see if there is any person around, not to mention the blue man, we did not even see a shadow after we took care of the coop. Now, did the ""Blue Boy"" save my chicken or could that be another being again? Oh, by the way we did not see that blue figure again and it did not leave any bad marks on us, Aya is still good and so am I. PS I am kind of happy this time because I finally got my friend to experience that ""Blue Boy"" which she would always ignore.",Experienced The Blue Boy Again,Japan,Apparitions / voices / touches,2025-06-10,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28539
57,Other,"Sometimes, we have to throw the towel in for some experiences that happen. One such experience was told to me by my grandpa before his demise (I miss him). In the bygone times, the men folk often used to play cards until wee hours. This incident happened during Diwali of 70's that made him quit his habit of playing cards. So, here's what all happened. The Diwali Night My grandpa was playing cards, not typical gambling, and granny wasn't pleased with his habit. So she randomly wished that he learns a lesson, just like wives often do when their stubborn husbands don't listen. Diwali generally falls on the new moon night, and it is said that new moon night is the time when dark powers and paranormal beings are hyperactive. Moreover, many occult practitioners or tantriks acquire siddhis, pretas, and a lot more that we are yet to explore. When he was done playing cards, he took his bicycle to pedal back home. Now on the way, he saw a frail Muslim guy asking for directions for Madarsa. He was lanky, wore a white kurta pyjama, skullcap, and had a long beard hanging until chest. My grandpa gave him directions, he said salaam, and both went their own ways. At the next turn, which was about 300 meters, my grandpa saw the same guy who repeated the same question. Again, the grandpa gave him directions, thinking that the poor guy might have misunderstood. When my grandpa saw him for the third time, he was surprised and didn't stop. Frightened, he started peddling faster to see the lanky old man two more times! You can imagine what happens when someone is stuck in such a loop. My grandpa started chanting some religious hymns and reached home. He was sweating profusely and told everything to his wife (my granny). Next Morning He was ill with the trauma he faced last night. A local doctor was called who prescribed some medicines and he was fine. Though this incident made him quit playing the game of cards, he was unable to decipher what was it that came to ask directions to the Madarsa? Was it a jinn, a ghost, or some divine energy that literally came to make him quit a habit without harming?",Where's The Madarsa?,India,Apparitions / voices / touches,2025-06-18,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28542
58,Haunted Places,"My grandpa passed away at my grandma's house. Soon after my cousin moved in and I would go sleep over every now and then. I was playing video games and I got hungry. My room was at the end of the hall and the room next to me was my grandma's. I usually check on her so I did and I heard my cousin at the other end of the hallway screaming at the game like always. I went make some ramen and go get my phone. I heard a loud noise from the kitchen and like I'm standing in front the bedroom door looking down the hall. I check on my grandma, she's sleeping and my cousin was still screaming. I end up calling my friend and telling them and I go check it out. There was a jug (it's a jug you have to go get filled at the store) it was a water dispenser. It's was a big one and it was empty, no way it could have gotten blown off and where it was made no sense. The jug is by the back door rocking back and forth like somebody threw it. The kitchen table is against the wall and to the right is a door way and to the right in that room is the laundry room but if you look straight through the door frame it's the back door. The way it landed and the way it had to have been thrown was far. I think it was my grandpa. I told my mom she said her and my dad was showering once over there and no one was home and she heard HEY! In a little girl's voice. I don't know if this is related or if that thing that threw that jug was grandpa cuz it happened after he died.

59,Other,"About a month prior to Christmas, 2009, my mother drove me to the Humane Society located within the town of Port Hope, Ontario where I had volunteered for a brief period. She claimed that she had a pleasant surprise waiting for me. Although I was well aware of the reason for our visit to the Humane Society, I decided to humour my mother and pretended to be ignorant of her intentions. Just a few months prior, we had sadly lost a black and white cat that we adopted in 2006, so it was very evident as to what was in store. We finally arrived at the Humane Society and my mother asked me to wait in the car for a few minutes. By the time I entered the shelter, I saw my mother standing by the front desk in the lobby; a small, black-furred kitten nestled comfortably in her arms. She then informed me that the adoption papers were signed and then decided to name him Pyewacket. Pyewacket was the name of a fictional cat depicted in my mother's favourite movie, the 1958 James Stewart film Bell Book and Candle. In his younger years, Pyewacket was very stubborn and ill-tempered for the most part. By August of 2017, once my mother became far too sick to continue watching over Pyewacket, my wife at the time and I decided to take him in. It was at around this time that he finally began warming up to me. From that moment forward, we became almost inseparable. Every morning when I returned home from working nights, Pyewacket would always stand excitedly by the door, anxiously awaiting my return. Other fond memories include finding him lying on piles of my old clothes I had absentmindedly left either on the bed or the coffee table. By the time my wife and I separated in July of 2022, I moved in with my father and he willingly allowed me to bring Pyewacket in. Most mornings, I would be awoken by Pyewacket jumping excitedly on my bed and settling down directly beside me. After getting a sufficient amount of attention from me, he would then habitually purr himself to sleep. Sadly, by early November, 2024, Pyewacket began appearing very weak and frail. He would spend most of his time casually lying in the bathtub. His refusal to eat regularly was especially concerning. After taking him to the nearest vet, my father informed me that his kidneys were beginning to shut down. On November 11th, he had clearly taken a turn for the worst. His kidneys had deteriorated so severely, that he was no longer able to maintain his balance. Even the slightest amount of bodily contact was enough to knock him over. At that moment, it was clearly evident that we would have to euthanize him. We drove Pyewacket to the same clinic as before. I decided to remain in the room with him for his final moments. His demeanor was strangely calm, as if he was completely unaware of the situation. From his point of view, it's possible that he believed he was there for a mere checkup. The room was eerily quiet, apart from the faint sound of a large dog panting in the lobby. The veterinarian then entered the room in a visibly dismal state. Though she had endeavored to remained stoic and professional, I could clearly surmise that her heart was on the verge of breaking. I stood beside Pyewacket, forcibly holding him still. He made three attempts to jump off the table and in his weakened state, the impact of the fall would have badly injured him. The moment the veterinarian had administered the drug that stopped his heart, Pyewacket immediately lost consciousness and his body flopped lifelessly to the side. She checked for vital signs and informed us that he was gone. We placed an order for Pyewacket's ashes in a ceramic urn, which we received the following week. It certainly helped provide a small amount of closure. The early morning hours would offer far more than I could have ever imagined. It was around 4:00 am approximately and I abruptly awoke dazed and confused due to the sensation of something unknown landing forcibly on my bed and gradually moving towards me. The instant it stopped just beside my chest, all was still once more. The whole experience seemed very surreal, yet due to the immediacy of the encounter after receiving Pyewacket's remains, I surmised that nothing, not even his passing would stop my best bud of fifteen years from always being nearby.",Best Buds,Canada,Pets / animals,2025-06-21,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28544
60,Haunted Places,"This happened last Sunday and I had lost my mind on it. I saw something that was a wild deception (Chhalava) while returning back from Jim Corbett. Although no one was harmed, neither of us had the guts to speak until we crossed that stretch. Here's the experience. The Backstory Date: 15 June 2025 Jim Corbett is engulfed in the Himayalan belt, so apart from panoramic views, it shrouds the dark side of nature. While driving, the dusk slithered and the roads got dark. The only source of light was the car headlights. I was seated at the backseat with my friend and stole a quick nap. We had to pass through a dense area when the driver, Brahmaji Rawat, advised to roll up the windows. We rolled up windows and he pushed the accelerator to full. He also said to keep calm and do not speak if ANYTHING HAPPENS. I and my friend were a bit surprised but followed his advice. Our cab was speeding when we sighted an old man crossing the road. I vividly remember his appearance - colored headgear and white kurta pyjama. I told the driver to slow down but he didn't pay heed and ran over the guy. The driver said to calm down, there's nothing and as we both turned behind, there was nothing! As if it vanished! The driver was nonchalant and we guys were scared to the bone. How come there was no sight of the old man if he was hit and the car ran over him? We took a break at a cafe in the city to recollect ourselves. The driver told us that villagers do not roam outside during wee hours, and there's definitely no reason for an old man to roam in that proximity. The Explanation: Brahmaji told us that it was a Chhalava, or deception. A Chhalava is a notorious ghost that roams the secluded areas in Uttarakhand. It usually appears at wee hours with an intent to harm travelers. He added that if we had stopped to check, either of us could have fallen prey to the Chhalava's hypnosis and met with an accident. That day, I practically experienced the mountains getting alive and why the elderly would warn to avoid traveling at night.

61,Other,"I am new at YGS and not a good story teller. So please forgive any of my mistakes as English is not my first language. The story is of hauntings that occurred with my sister let's call her Pooja. It all started a few days ago, when a very weird series of incidents began in my house. It was just another night, peaceful and quiet, until it was shattered by a piercing scream. It was my sister, screaming in the middle of the night. My mother, alarmed, rushed to her, calming her down and asking what had happened. My sister, still trembling, told us she had seen a boy standing outside her window. We were all shocked. My sister's room is on the fifth floor, and there's no balcony. How could anyone be standing outside her window? It felt impossible, a waking nightmare. Two days later, around 10 PM, it happened again. My sister came screaming for the same reason: the sight of a boy outside her window. That night, she couldn't bring herself to sleep alone, so she slept with my mom. Now, my mom was truly concerned. She decided we needed to do a Havan on an auspicious day, which was two days away. It was our only hope, a spiritual cleansing to ward off whatever malevolent presence had invaded our home. The day before the Havan, the terror escalated dramatically. My sister screamed again. This time, she wasn't just seeing the boy outside the window; she claimed he was standing beside her bed, pulling her blanket. My mom immediately ran to her room, but when she got there, she found nothing. Just an empty space where my sister said the boy had been. As my mom turned to leave, something truly horrifying happened. She froze, her body rigid, and then she passed out. We called a doctor, who gave her medicine. When she finally came to, she told us what had happened. As she was turning, a completely dark shadow appeared directly in front of her. It passed through her body, vanished, and she lost consciousness. The fear in our house was palpable, growing with every new incident. The next day, despite the recent horrors, the Havan was organized. We prayed it would bring an end to our nightmare. But what unfolded was the biggest terror I have ever seen. About ten minutes into the Havan, the situation took a horrifying turn. Suddenly, my sister was no longer herself. A malevolent presence seemed to grip her. It entered my sister's body. My sister immediately started shaking her head badly, violently. Pandit Ji, with a grim determination, quickly made a protective circle around her using sindoor, salt, and some powder. Then, he started to speak, addressing the entity directly. ""Who are you? Why did you come on her? Leave that innocent girl!"" My sister began to speak, but it wasn't her voice. It was the deep, adult voice of a man. He kept repeating, ""Isse lekar jaaunga! Isse lekar jaaunga!"" (I will take her! I will take her!) Pandit Ji then took some Ganga Jal and threw it on her. My sister, or rather the entity possessing her, immediately cried out in pain, saying, ""Rook jaa, battata hu, battata hu, ganga jal mat chidak!"" (Stop, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, don't sprinkle Ganga Jal!) Under duress, the entity began to speak. He said his name was Rahul, and he had died in a road accident. But his soul, he claimed, had been captured by one of our own relatives. They had sent him to kill Pooja, my sister. He revealed they had done it by mixing some ""toona"" (black magic) into a ladoo and giving it to her. Then, he started laughing, a chilling, triumphant sound, and again declared, ""Tum mujhe nahi rok sakte! Isse lekar jaaunga!"" (You cannot stop me! I will take her!) Undeterred, Pandit Ji began chanting powerful mantras. My sister started crying, very, very badly, very, very loudly. The entity was clearly in immense pain. Suddenly, my sister started vomiting. Pandit Ji quickly collected the vomit in a pot. It was blackish in colour and have very bad odour. He then covered the pot with a red cloth. After a few minutes, the shaking stopped. The male voice was gone. My sister, slowly, got normal. Since that terrifying Havan, everything has gone back to normal. The shadows are gone. The screams have stopped. The fear has lifted. It was the most horrific experience of our lives, but thankfully, it seems to be over.",The Ghost At Window,India,Apparitions / voices / touches,2025-06-26,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28547
62,Other,"Friends today the incident which I am going to tell you all is a very strange experience which I had almost thirteen years ago. I always feel as if it has taken place just quite a few days back. My parents had gone out to meet my sister at her in-laws place and I was alone at home. So to have fresh air I went onto our balcony from which when I looked down I saw a white blanket lying down on the ground of the building which is in front of our building. Initially I thought it was someone's white blanket which must have fallen down by mistake but what my eyes saw from the balcony increased my heartbeat and I felt that I could collapse with fear any moment or have a big heart-attack. It was not a blanket but either a girl or woman smiling in a evil manner in white clothes towards the building in front of our house and our house too and she was looking sharply around her as suppose to find a victim. I hid down in fear of getting caught in her ghostly clutches and came back inside my house. Suddenly the atmosphere in my house turned evil and our tv power went away along with the electricity of course. I started trembling with fear badly and tried to sleep but now I started feeling that someone in the kitchen was watching me with a angry look as if it could kill me any moment. Although scared I went inside the kitchen to look, as I felt something or someone was there, with my torch in my hand and came back empty handed and tried to sleep but no use as I had the same feeling of being watched continuously by someone in a very angry manner as I have previously mentioned before itself that it could kill me. I couldn't sleep that night and finally went to sleep at four o clock in the morning and my parents arrived at eight thirty in the morning. I told my mother about this incident and she dismissed it saying that better ignore such evil things and focus on yourself. Many years have passed, but I still wonder what the woman was and what was watching me angrily in our own house whom I felt wished to kill me despite me seeing completely nothing is a question that still continues to puzzle me until this date.

63,Haunted Places,"The story I am about to tell happened to me about 15 years back. It all happened when we were living in a house in Pannipitiya. I use to work for a media company and we would have to work very odd times sometimes early in the morning we would start work and come back home again at midnight and it go's on like that. One night I finished work and came home around 12:30am. My bedroom was like an office room in the house. I jumped at the idea of taking it since there was a door I could go out to the garden in our back yard. I had just started smoking cigarettes and no one in my house knew about it at the time. I have to say I see a lot of unexplainable things and am scared to the bone but still very curious and am very much used to all ghost and evil stories thanks to my grandparents. They would sit us (some of us who show we are brave enough to listen to all what they have experienced in their lives with the dead. So coming back to the night in particular I came home parked the car in and went to my room and before taking a shower got that urge to have cigarette now the time would have been around 12:45am. I open my door to the back yard and sitting on the step lit my cigarette and took couple of pulls. Just about 15 feet away, we had a big mango tree suddenly I saw someone peep from behind the tree. I got a bit alarmed and stood up and asked who is it (ya I know 1st thing I should have done is run in and close the door) but no I had to know who it was we have a lot of harmless thieves who would just randomly jump in and take a clothe dryer or something small to get their drug dose for the day. Still smoking for the second time again this person was peeing I shouted am calling the police and was near my door now when suddenly it was a man dressed all in white he was old because the hair was all white as well no face was just floating towards me I can't remember how and what happen after that. When I open my eyes I was in my sister's room when she started shaking me to ask what had happen as she had woken up when I had jumped on to her bed. Later we found out the house is built on a old gave yard we lived there for almost 10 years and yes there is so much more I can tell but that's for a another day.",The Man Behind The Tree,Sri Lanka,Haunted places,2025-07-01,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28549

I have had a lot of paranormal experiences since childhood but there's this one particular which makes me go deep into thoughts almost 10 years later. So, back in April 2016, my mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis and it was the most difficult time of my life. I was 13 years old and her condition was extreme and even doctors gave up on her treatment. She was going to die within a week when this incident happened. As usual, I was sleeping beside her in our 3bhk room on the top floor. My father was sleeping in hall adjacent to our room. Some nights before her death, the time was 2:30ish am, I was having a nightmare of some ghost crying in an absolute scary manner and I got scared and woke up and open my eyes- but to my HORROR- that same crying sound was coming into my room! My mother was awake before me and was scared to death then she quickly held my hand as to not react to the crying sound. The crying sound was way more terrifying than any horror movie I've ever watched until date. It was of some entity as there is no way any cat, or any thing can enter my room in night. There was some chatter about my nani (maternal grandmother) 's house being haunted by some evil female chudail (witch). I would observe things sitting on table move on their own, sounds of ghungroos (anklets at night). Could it be related to that spirit? Maybe negative energies got attracted towards my mother who was going to die within few days. Can anyone tell what it could be?

When I was just 9-10 years old, I had a very bad experience and very negative. My mom had stayed here when we moved in, I knew something was badly off. I started noticing it when mom would get angry more and easier. I knew being a single parent was bad enough and ever since I was a kid, I'm a magnet for spirits and demonic entities. It's terrifying when you're just a kid. It started off when moms' emotions would increase, the smallest things could set her off. I could understand why maybe it was stress until... That quickly changed. Started to hear footsteps at night, knockings, slamming kitchen cabinets would wake me up. I thought it was mom, but I would get up and to find her always fast asleep. One day a childhood friend of mine came to stay the night little did I know that was the last night we stayed there; we encountered evil. My friend and I were in the bedroom playing with toys, when all the sudden I saw a shadow dark run across the wall. I pointed at it and asking her did you see that she looked at me in fear like she saw the whole thing not just a shadow. I screamed for my mom, tears down my face, ""I saw it! I saw a shadow!"" My mom saw my fear and felt it. She contacted her close friend and we cleansed what we could of out apartment and never looked back. Later that week mom found out that the buildings were built on very bad Indian burial ground, many deaths followed, and the apartments continue to haunt the living to this day.",The Haunting Of Willows Apartments,United States,Haunted places,2025-07-21,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28557
66,Haunted Places,"Yesterday an old friend of the family passed away. V didn't want anyone visiting toward the end, only her immediate family. I wanted so badly to spend more time with her but I respected her wishes. About a year ago I knew something was wrong with her; it was a gut feeling and nothing more. As the months went by I dreamt about her a lot. In most of these dreams I'm standing on the road outside her house. I know I can't get in and I don't try. They're sad dreams. In one dream I find a path beside one of the front gates. I enter through this path, it leads me to their house. But the house isn't there, it's like it was never built and I can't find my way out again. All dreams are in daylight. I never asked V if she was okay or if she was ill. A part of me knew not to and another part of me didn't want to know. She's never been the best when it comes to doctors and conversations relating to medical topics always fall flat. About ten years ago V had another medical scare but came out without a scratch. With little to no medical treatment. She really thought she'd live forever and so did everyone else if we're honest. Last night I was at home tidying up. While I was dusting a desk I felt V suddenly behind me. It was such a strong feeling and I could see her in my mind stood behind me. I didn't turn around but I said her name and the feeling got stronger still. I could see clearly in my mind how she was standing, what she was wearing, how her hair was styled, everything. In my mind I could see her touching my shoulders in a half hug, way you do when you're comforting someone. When V touched my shoulders there was such an intense unmistakable feeling of her being right there. After a moment I shook the feeling off and walked away because I didn't want this to be what I believed it to be. Wish I hadn't done that. Last night I kept dreaming of V. Just random stuff like sitting in their kitchen chatting, their dogs being rowdy. One dream was of one of her lampshades which she made for me when I was a wee lass. I have it sitting out ready for an old lamp that needs rewiring. Today I got the call that she had passed away. I don't know what time it happened, only that it happened yesterday. While I was on the phone the call kept going into static sounds. At one point the phone beeped a long kind of 'beep' sound. Never heard my phone make that noise. I was talking to my dad, who informed me. The paranormal is a no go topic for him so I didn't bring it up, not sure if he heard anything on his end. I know it sounds cliché but V's always been an inspiration to me. In that she's always been unapologetically herself. Her passion for antique everything was completely unmatched and her home was the most haunted place I've ever known. I wrote about their ghosties years ago on here. The eccentric couple with the big ole posh place. V was born into extreme wealth but was a hippy and artist at heart. Never worked a day in her life. Dedicated much of her time to helping others. She was so generous with people, often times to her own detriment. She would often have people in need live with her, usually recovering addicts. Which was often dangerous as V and her husband are big into recreational substances. It usually ended badly, very badly. V was beaten up a few times by some of the people she took in. Her heart was always in the right place but she could be very naive. I don't think it's completely sunk in yet. I thought writing about last night would make me feel something but I'm kind of just numb. On a slightly unrelated note about a year ago I was watching a horror on Netflix. In this movie someone holds a duck out from around a doorway or around a corner or something. It's a white duck and someone holds it out so it's like looking at you from the doorway. It's a silly quirky scene but it scared the bejesus out of me. For anyone who may remember, when I wrote about V's place years ago I wrote about a duck puppet that stuck its head around the doorway when we were kids. I thought V's daughter had done this and ran towards the puppet but nothing was there. So, did someone from Netflix read that or what?

67,Haunted Places,"I have lived in Hokkaido for ten years. A few days before the event, I visited Nibutani, a village where the Ainu people preserve their culture and traditions. An elder told me about Ke-saru, a spirit said to live deep in the forest and watch those who enter. He explained,""Ke-saru doesn't chase people, but it watches carefully. If someone is careless or disrespectful, it takes more than just fear."" The name Ke-saru means""face peeler""in the Ainu language, referring to the spirit's dangerous nature toward those who show arrogance or disrespect in the forest. Before I left, the elder taught me a prayer to say if I ever felt the spirit nearby,""Kamuy ceppesuy."" This means,""Spirit, please return to your home."" The Ainu believe that spirits called kamuy live in all parts of nature, animals, plants, rivers, and the wind. While hiking alone in the Hidaka Mountains, the air suddenly became cold. All birds singing, wind rustling leaves stopped completely. Then, I saw a dark shape moving slowly between the trees. It was too large and moved too quietly to be a bear or any animal I know around. At that moment, I felt a heavy pressure and had difficulty breathing. Remembering the elder's words, I whispered the prayer,""Kamuy ceppesuy."" For several seconds, the Shadow stayed still before silently disappearing into the darkness. When I returned to Nibutani and told the elder what happened, he said, ""It saw you. You are lucky it let you go."" Since then, I have avoided walking alone in that part of the forest. The silence and shadows are not just empty, they feel like something is watching. Did I encounter the Ke-saru or can anyone explain what happened?",A Shadow In The Forest,Japan,Haunted places,2025-07-30,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28563
68,Other,"At the end of May this year, I lost my umbrella. This fact had me very confused as I do not use my umbrella very much, and usually use it to walk to the gym when it's raining. Just as info, I have zero psychic ability. None. But I have been reading stories on YGS for over 10 years as I find the subject interesting. I looked everywhere for this umbrella. I live in a Victorian terrace with limited space so there are a finite number of places to look. I even went to my car and checked in there. On the back seat of my car, behind the driver, I keep two cloth shopping bags and I moved them out of the way to look at the back seat (even though I can't imagine why I would put it on the back seat) but I saw nothing. Each week these 2 bags would be used and returned to the same spot. Shortly before I was due to go on holiday the 3rd week of June, I returned my bags to the back seat and there sat my umbrella. I was quite nonplussed. I was sure that I had carefully looked at the back seat weeks before. I park as close to my front door as I am able because parking is first come first served. I got back from my holiday, and on June 3rd I was making something to eat, and reached into a lower cupboard for a can of baked beans. I always have baked beans - they are a staple. My hand grabbed air. I bent down to have a look, stuck my hand into the space where there should have been cans, put my arm all the way to the back and zilch. No beans. I was really surprised that I had run out as I hate running out of anything. Next day when I did some shopping I bought a couple of cans to go in the cupboard. When I tried to insert the new cans I heard a clink. I looked into the cupboard and there were two cans of beans there. As you can imagine, I was beginning to wonder if I was losing the plot. On the 10th of July (and this is where I went back and wrote dates down) I took a bus to meet someone for coffee in a town about 3 miles away. While I was on the bus I looked at my hands and noticed that I had not put on my rings and bangle. A few months ago I realized that I really should wear my jewelery more as it was silly to leave it in the jewelry box, so I had two rings resized and started wearing them more. The only problem is that at times the rings and bangle get really annoying. When home, I often put them on my computer desk and put them on from there before I go out. If they annoy me when I am out I pull them off, and slip them into the front zip pocket of my shoulder bag. I thought about when I had last seen the jewelry and could not remember seeing the pieces by the pc before I left, so I thought that perhaps I had forgotten to take them out of my handbag after the last time I wore them. I unzipped the front pouch, which is probably about 25cm x 20cm, slid my hand back and forth and resolved to look for the rings and bangle when I got home as the pocket was empty. Had my coffee, got on the bus to go home and started to put my bus pass into the front zip pocket. As soon as I slipped my hand in, I felt my bangle which is gold and fairly heavy and noticeable, and the rings were there too. After the beans incident I had started to wonder if I had a spirit in my home with me, and the jewelry incident really reinforced that thought except for one thing. I was a couple of miles from home when I found the empty pocket, and about 3 miles away from home when I could feel my stuff again. And this is where I really started to wonder if I was losing it. How did ""my"" spirit know that I would be looking for my jewelry on the bus, and how did it put it back in for me when I was not at home? Can these entities move around with you? I have been meaning to set up an account here, but I am a great procrastinator. Yesterday I was sitting in my recliner for a few minutes before going out. I had been ready to post everything after I set up an account, but I procrastinated for a couple of weeks, and then yesterday something new happened. I leave my Kindle Fire on the arm of my recliner. It was unplugged and to my left while I checked something out before leaving. I looked over and it turned on. Now, if there is no power plugged in, I must hold the power button to a 5 count before it turns on, so somebody was trying to be helpful, which it would have been if not for the fact I was going out. I am of an age where quite a few people have Alzheimers and/or dementia, and I really would rather not join that group, so if someone with more knowledge than me would care to comment on the question of can spirits follow you around locally, I would be relieved if some do and that I am still sane.",Am I Losing The Plot?,United Kingdom,Misc,2025-08-05,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28565
69,Haunted Places,"It has been a VERY LONG time since I have visited YGS and had someone not reached out to me via FB I am not sure I would have returned, but here I am and a BIG thank you to the individual who reached out to me. 2024 was not a good year for myself or Family. In January we saw the passing of my Mother. Her health had been in decline (heart issues) and was in assisted living in the Dallas Tx area. In May we received the 'midnight' phone call that wakes you from your peace. My Oldest Son (Lawrence) had collapsed at work, he worked 3rd shift (overnights) at a Local Floor and Decor, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He had suffered a Bi-lateral pulmonary embolism. My Father -in-Law, who's health was failing (Type 1 Diabetes Complications) moved in us in June, by the first week of August he was placed on Home Hospice and passed away later that same month (yes, he passed in my house). In the year since, some 'odd' things have happened either to individuals in the household or with-in the house itself. 1st: When home alone I hear someone moving upstairs in my Son's old room. I 'played' it off as it being our dog (a 13-14 year old 50-60 pound Huskey with a bad hip) only to realize he was at my feet as I sat on the couch. A quick 'cat check' shows that both of out cats are also in the living room with me. 2nd: Each Family member has felt Lawrence's presence at one time or another, up to and including hearing his voice saying something... Not sure if this is just us remembering how he would speak with us or if he is actually interacting with us still, but it's defiantly his 'sarcastic' / snarky type comments. 3rd: Not sure how people feel about seeing individuals that have crossed over in their dreams, but my Wife has had two very vivid dreams about Lawrence, she describes them as 'feeling' real. The first one he was comforting her because he had passed away, he assured her that 'he was needed' on the other side... The next day is when we received the coroner's report detailing what had caused his death... A pulmonary embolism, is enough to take someone, he had suffered a Bi-Lateral (one in both Lungs) Pulmonary Embolism and there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The other dream she described was 'just as real' but he was simply comforting her, at least that's all she could remember about it. So, there it is... 2024 was a very rough year for our Family, still dealing with so, so many things from last year, but making progress.

70,Haunted Places,"Ooookay, I was totally joking at the end of my last post when I said I'd post again in five years. But here it is, five years later. Looks like I'm going to be unintentionally posting every five years on here. On 29 June 2021, I moved to San Francisco. It's where I'd always wanted to move, but couldn't for various reasons. Well, a really good friend of mine told me that I could live with them. They lived with their family and their family said I could stay until the end of the year, then I'd have to find my own place. That seemed perfectly fair. In 2017, their grandmother passed away. I always assumed she passed away in the hospital because I remembered my friend telling me they rushed her to the hospital, and a few days later they told me she passed. But every time I was by the bathroom in front of her old room, I'd get this strange feeling there was a presence. That little hallway had that feeling. It didn't feel evil or scary, it actually felt calming. I told my friend, and they said, ""That's Baachan. She's watching over us"". My friend is Japanese and that's the term they call their grandmother. I asked if she passed in the hospital like I thought, and they said, ""No, she hated it there. We brought her home to rest in her own bed, and she passed away that night"". However, the basement was another story. Or rather... First floor? Basements are weird here in San Francisco. In their house and the one I'm currently living, there are steps leading to second floor, which acts as the first floor. The ground floor is considered a basement even though it's fully above ground. I've lived here four years, and I'm still confused by it. I live on the third floor but it's technically the second floor... Anyway, we had to go to the basement to do laundry. We never liked being down there because the air felt thick and evil. My friend's family had bought the house back in the 1950s and their mother had grown up in it, and she told me it was like that when she was a little girl. She hated being down there and doesn't go down there unless she has to. I asked if something happened down there and she said if it did it was before her family bought the house, but it definitely feels like some really bad energy is down there. So, I got a job there, saved up and moved into my current house on 5 January 2022. I'm renting a room in a house, and it's a really nice neighbourhood in the Richmond. That's not doxing myself, the Richmond is fifty blocks long and like ten blocks wide. It's a very big area. It didn't take me long to notice that the house was haunted. At least the hallway. Even in the daytime I feel like something is chasing me when I walk down it and I rush back to my room. A friend of mine looked up this address on SF Chronicles archives and found out there had been a murder here in the '80s. There weren't any specific details like if it was in the top floor hallway or something. But that's the only thing we found that could explain it. There are four rooms on my floor. My room is at the end of the hall facing the outside. I look out my window and see the street. The room next to mine, there was someone living there when I moved out. He moved out a year into me living here and someone else moved in, he's still here. The room at the end of the hall, the same person has lived there since before I moved in. I mention all this to talk about the last room. I call it the middle room even though there are four rooms. I guess it'd be the middle room in that hall, since mine is at the end of the hall. Anyway, I've always called it the cursed room. The guy who was living there when I moved in moved out a month later. In the three and a half years I've lived in this house, we've had six different people move in and out. The short time was two weeks. I came home from work and he was moving his stuff out. I asked what was going on and he just said, ""I can't do this anymore"". I asked what he meant and he just repeated it. The current tenant there seems to be paranoid. When he moved in a couple months ago, he told me that he had to move out of his last place because his landlord was having the tenants spy on him. I was like, ""Oh, that's messed up!"". But then he started talking about hidden cameras in his room and I felt like maybe his last landlord didn't have him spied on. A couple weeks ago I was coming up the stairs from taking out the trash. His room is directly in front of the stairs, and as I was nearing the top, he opened his door and told me I needed to stop standing outside his door listening in. I was confused and he said, ""Don't bother denying it, I caught you three times"". The other way I was coming up the stairs from talking with a friend at the front door who had come to pick up something. As I was nearing the top he threw open his door and startled me. I laughed and told him he startled me. He goes, ""I told you to stay out of my room! You need to leave me alone!"". Honestly, I don't know if that has anything to do with the activity here or if he's just mentally ill, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was a presence outside his room and he thinks it's one of us. Something happened a couple of days ago that made me want to write all this down. Our bathroom is split between two rooms. Okay, from my room looking down the hall, on the left side are my roommates' rooms. On the left side is an empty closet, the stairs, and the two bathroom doors, and the kitchen at the end of the hall. The first bathroom is literally just the toilet, the size of a porta-potty. Really tiny. The second door is the shower and sink. It sounds inconvenient, but with four people living there, it's been very convenient. Anyway, a couple days ago I was in the first bathroom and I could hear someone taking a shower. I could see the light on, and the windows were open and I could very clearly hear the shower going. I was thinking to myself, ""I'll just wash my hands in the kitchen"", like we usually do in that situation. Well, I leave the bathroom, the sound still going and light still on through the window, and when I close the door behind me... The second bathroom door is open, and the light is off and no one is in there. No shower going, the floor and walls are dry. I stood there, my blood frozen. It was seriously eerie. Okay, that's enough about my living haunting situations. I'll talk about my San Francisco working haunting situations. That's a weird wording, but I'm going to keep it. First job I got was on Fisherman's Wharf at a souvenir shop standing outside going, ""Everything is $10!"". That was literally my entire job. That's the job that paid for me to move out of my friend's house. But a week after I moved into this house, the store abruptly closed. I frantically looked for another one and was lucky enough to find one with one day left in the month. My landlord is very understanding. It was an organic market on Polk, and I loved it there. A lot of the friends I have made here were either coworkers there or regular customers there. A minor celebrity was a regular there and she and I talked every week. It was so much fun working there! Even if it was haunted like crazy! There was the obvious stuff like stuff falling off shelves that weren't near the edge, stuff moving around or not where we left them. There were times we saw figures cross between aisles even though we knew no one else was in the store. I even had a similar experience that happened in Ohio. A coworker and I were discussing the hauntings, and a loaf of bread flew off the shelf and hit the counter. We decided to change the subject. The same thing happened in Ohio except it was a bag of chips. In 2023 the store was bought by another, bigger store and closed down and we were all let go. I had saved up thousands of dollars by then, which was lucky because that paid my rent until I got another job in March 2024. My current job, in fact. I'm a photographer at a landmark. Obviously not going to say which one. We take pictures of guests as they enter and try to sell them souvenir sets of their photos as they leave. We all know the area is haunted, but it's hard to prove because we're outside. We just know mostly because we can feel it. There were two incidents that really solidified it, though. Several months ago, I opened up (I'm a lead there) and when I unlocked the office there were photo cards everywhere. I called the person who closed the night before and asked them what the heck happened. He was completely confused; it wasn't like that when he left. I knew he was lying so I had to report it to my district manager. An hour later she texted me a video showing that... It wasn't him. Oh, the photo cards are cards with QR codes we scan when we take the pictures and hand to the guests. There are 1,000 in each box. Anyway, there was an open box on the table in the office and in the middle of the night, they started flying out of the box of their own accord. I asked her if I could share the video and she said absolutely not. What's with corporate not wanting these things getting out? Honestly, I think that'd give us more visitors. The other thing that happened was we often hear our names called from behind the sales area. There will be no one over there and one of us will hear our name being called from back there. No one else can hear it, but almost all of us have heard it. Even the skeptical ones have heard it, though they have tried to dismiss it as the wind. But it even happens when the wind isn't blowing, or even no breeze. The air could be still and we'll still hear it. It's always eerie. I've been working there for a year and a half and have heard it many times and am not used to it. We had a sixteen-year-old girl start working there last year. I was standing next to her on her first night and she suddenly screamed. I jumped and asked what happened. She said, ""I heard someone saying my name!"" and she ran behind the sales area and screamed again because no one was back there. I involuntarily laughed and said, ""Oh, you'll get used to that"", even though like I said I'm still not used to it. Needless to say, she quit after about a week. She said it was because she hated working outside, though. I'm going to end this by talking about something nobody likes talking about. I've walked the Golden Gate Bridge so many times now that I don't even take pictures every time anymore. It's just a large bridge that just happens to be one of the most famous in the world. No big deal. But as I'm sure everyone knows, it's well-known for the unfortunately high number of people who have jumped off of it over the course of its existence. I don't know if you've walked on it, but you can definitely feel it when you're walking on it. There's an air of sadness when you're walking across it. No matter what I'm doing, be it listening to happy music or in a call with my best friend, there's an unmistakable feeling of sadness, dread, and regret when walking on that bridge. I've never specifically seen anything, but I think it's because I'm kind of sensitive to that sort of thing that I feel it so much. I've walked it with a friend of mine once who isn't sensitive to the paranormal and she didn't feel anything. Heck, at this point, I don't even know if what I feel on the bridge is even paranormal anymore. There's been so many jumpers over the past century, those emotions are essentially baked in by now. They have nets in place now so there have been less attempts lately. Someone did jump a couple months ago. I saw him lying on the net refusing help. Last I saw, they were guiding him off. So, the nets are definitely saving lives. Either as a deterrent or by literally catching people who try. I guess I'll see you all in five years lol.","Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City",United States,Haunted places,2025-08-11,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28570
71,Haunted Places,"I went camping for two nights at a small site up in the mountains, next to a slow-moving stream. The water ran clear over stones, and deer wandered through the area occasionally, which is normal in Hokkaido. The air smelled damp and earthy, with a faint hint of pine. I rode up on my side-car. The road was quiet, and the forest on either side felt still, but the ride itself was normal. The first night was uneventful. I heard only the stream, the occasional rustle of leaves, and a few distant birds. The second night was different. I woke sometime after midnight because the forest felt unusually still. The stream was quieter, and then I heard voices. At first, they were faint, blending with the water. But it was clear they were human voices, not animal sounds. One voice, soft and high-pitched, sounded like a woman speaking in short, broken phrases. It drifted slowly through the area, fading in and out. I stayed still and listened. After a few minutes, the voices faded completely, leaving only the stream. When I was leaving the next morning, I mentioned it to the caretaker. He didn't look surprised. He said quietly that people sometimes hear things in that part of the mountain, and that in the past, a few people have gone missing there. He didn't give any details, and I didn't ask. I don't know what I heard that night. Maybe it was someone lost, maybe it was just the way sound carries in the forest. But the voices by the stream have stayed with me.

Today I had to go to work to a place a bit far from where I live and one of my coworkers was to pick me up at 6:00 AM. Since this is way too early for the time I usually get up, I decided to sleep in my daughter's bedroom so not to disturb my husband's sleep. I prepared my stuff and a good lunch and set the alarm with enough time to let me get ready, have a good breakfast and tend to the cat's needs before leaving, I thought one hour and 20 minutes would be enough time to do everything without rushing. Anyway, at some point I had a dream, perhaps even a nightmare, in which I was going to get together with my friends from university, they arrived at my place and I wasn't ready. I began looking for something to wear but couldn't find anything suitable, mismatched socks, flowery blouses and plaid skirts and homely dresses that would had made me look like a pauper beside my elegantly dressed friends. I went out and told my friends that I'd be ready in two minutes, but was moving with the speed of a snail and knew I would make everyone else late for whatever event we were attending. My parents were watching me from the background, and Mom said ""Se te va a hacer tarde"" (You are going to be late).

73,Haunted Places,"""This is something that happened to my mother around 45 - 50 years ago..."" During her childhood, my mother used to spend her summer holidays in a small village called Naginenipally, at her eldest sister-in-law's house. Like most children of her age, she was playful, curious, and a little adventurous. In that village, there was an old well that everyone whispered about. The elders often warned children to stay away from it, saying it was haunted. Naturally, this only fueled the curiosity of the kids. One day, when all the elders were busy with work, my mother and her close friend slipped away to see the well for themselves. They played around it for some time. Neither of them knew how to swim, so they never dared to get too close. But then something terrifying happened. Out of nowhere, a woman draped in a black saree appeared. She was carrying burning coal wrapped in her saree, yet the cloth did not catch fire. With a swift motion, she threw the burning coal in front of the children. Shocked and terrified, the two girls ran back to the house, trembling with fear. Days later, despite the incident, their curiosity got the better of them. They returned to the well. But this time, what they experienced was even more chilling. From deep inside the well, they began to hear a voice calling out the name of my mother's friend. At first faint, it grew louder and louder, echoing through the air until it felt unbearably close. The girls fled in horror. That very night, my mother's friend developed a high fever. Even as she lay in her home, she claimed to hear the same voice calling her name again and again. Though her fever eventually subsided, she never recovered from the fear. Within a few days...

74,Haunted Places,"I live in Hokkaido, and my yard used to have an old well. It had been there long before I moved in, tucked away behind shrubs and an aging shed. I rarely used it, maybe only only once in a while for watering plants? But otherwise it sat quietly, almost forgotten. The area where I live has long had a reputation for being haunted. Over the years I've grown used to it. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, faint voices can be heard, like distant prayers carried on the wind. They've weakened as time has passed, and I've come to accept them as part of the atmosphere here. But what happened when I arranged to close the well felt entirely different. In the days leading up to the ceremony, strange things began to occur. At night, dogs from far-off homes barked and howled in the direction of my property, though there was nothing visible in the yard. Inside my own house, I would wake to muffled knocking sounds, low and insistent, as though coming from beneath the ground. The night before the priest was due to arrive, I saw something I still can't explain. At dusk, I noticed a shape near the well. At first it looked like an animal crouched close to the ground, but as I focused on it, the form seemed to stretch upward, taking on the blurred outline of a person. It never came into focus... Always shadowy, indistinct... Before vanishing altogether. When I went to check, the ground around the stones was damp, though it hadn't rained in days. On the morning of the ceremony, the air in the yard felt unusually heavy, as though the place itself was holding its breath. The priest performed the purification, but later admitted it had been harder than usual, as if something resisted the prayers. When the ritual was finished and the well was sealed, the disturbances ceased. The dogs grew quiet, the knocking sounds never returned, and I haven't seen that shadowy figure again. Even so, the memory lingers. The distant prayers that sometimes drift through my area feel familiar now, almost harmless. But the things I experienced during the well-closing were different... Very active, immediate, and unsettling in a way I won't soon forget. Do you think the spirits tied to the well are still here, or did they fade away like the voices of those midnight prayers?","Did They Fade, Or Do They Remain?",Japan,Haunted places,2025-08-25,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28574
75,Haunted Places,"There is a small Japanese-style washoku restaurant I sometimes go to. It is an old place with a wooden sign and a sliding door. Inside the floor is covered with tatami, the tables are low, and the smell of grilled fish and dashi hangs in the air. The menu is fixed, with set meals of rice, miso soup, simmered vegetables, pickles, and fish. People in the neighborhood have spoken about the place for years. They say that if you stay there too late, unusual things begin to happen. I never believed it until one night I went there with my friend. It was close to closing time. The dining room was empty except for us. The waitress came to take our orders, bowed politely, and walked quickly down the corridor toward the kitchen. Her footsteps echoed unnaturally against the floor. While we waited, the light above our table flickered. We both looked up, then shrugged it off. A few minutes later, a clatter broke the silence. A pair of chopsticks had fallen onto the tatami from the table next to ours. The strange thing was that no one had been sitting there. Not long after, I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was light, like the touch of a waiter. I turned, but no one was there. When I looked forward again, the waitress was just then coming out of the kitchen, carrying our trays with both hands. We ate quietly. The food was the same as always, but the silence of the room pressed down on us. After the last orders were served, the kitchen lights went out. I heard the faint sound of pans being stacked, and then there was nothing. Suddenly a loud crash echoed from the kitchen. A pan had fallen to the floor. No one moved and no one spoke. The kitchen remained dark. When the waitress returned with the bill, she said nothing about it. She bowed as usual, but I noticed her hand shaking slightly. We paid quickly and left. As the sliding door closed behind us, the light above the entrance flickered once. Later I tried to learn more about the rumors. I discovered that about fifty years ago, the owner of the restaurant had a violent quarrel with his wife. He struck her, not realizing she was pregnant. The baby was lost. The woman's mind gave way after that. Some time later she killed him in the restaurant's kitchen. It is said that the man still lingers in the dining room, and the woman remains in the kitchen, waiting for the one who took her child. When I think back to the tap on my shoulder and the chopsticks falling from the empty table, I cannot help wondering which one of them it was... Perhaps it was the man?",Rumor Or Real?,Japan,Haunted places,2025-08-26,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28575
76,Other,"This event happened last Tuesday morning (8-19-25). I have a habit of being awake in the wee hours of the morning on a fairly regular basis. This particular morning I was up late working on some music projects. I had my earbuds in listening to a track when suddenly I heard 3 loud rapid knocks right at the window behind my bed's headboard. It scared the living s#!+ out of me! Startled, I snatched out my earbuds and laid low for a brief moment wondering who in the h*! Could be knocking on my window at this time of the morning. This has never happened before so I'm there ducked down trying to process what just happened. In those brief moments my mind is racing and I thought for a second could it have been one of my household relatives that went outside and perhaps locked themselves out? Then I thought could it be someone from around the neighborhood up to no good or perhaps needing something? Then I thought that maybe I was hearing things, but the knocking was LOUD and I actually felt the THUD of the window. That's actually what got my attention, and it was loud enough that I heard it beyond my earbuds. I quickly jumped out of bed and grabbed my pistol. I then slowly peeped out the blinds of the window to see if anyone was out there but oddly there was no one there. That side of the house is well lit by a nearby street light and my car was right there next to that window. Still peeping out the window I looked around the car and waited to see if maybe someone was hiding behind it on the other side, but I didn't see anyone. I angled my gaze downward to see if anyone might have ducked down below the window alongside the house but no one was in sight. I then went out of my bedroom and slowly peaked around the corner into the front room to see if by chance anyone else was awake and happened to make a loud noise which I thought was at the window, but came from another part of the house instead. However, I saw that they were all sound asleep, snoring loudly. I then peaked out the blinds in the front room (where my relatives were sleeping) to look out in the yard but I saw no one in the yard. If someone were to flee it would've took them a few minutes to get far enough to exit the yard, and they would've been well in view of the street light. I went back in my bedroom and looked at the clock on my laptop. I saw it was 2:48, right before 3am (which is said to be ""Witching Hour""). At this point I'm on edge and starting to think that it may have been something paranormal happening. For the sake of protection I burned some sage and told whatever it was to leave me alone and return where it came from. I laid back down in bed on edge for the remainder of the morning until daybreak, but nothing else ever did happen. The following night came and I again, was awake in the wee hours. Naturally I was on edge waiting for something to happen again but nothing ever did.

77,Haunted Places,"Brother and sisters, The story is of my best friend. Let's call him Kapil. I am an eye witness of this. This all happened during the lockdown in 2021. Kapil, my best friend, had been telling me about these really vivid and scary dreams he was having, always between 2 and 3 AM. He also mentioned experiencing sleep paralysis. One day, with our exams approaching, I went over to his place for a night study session. It got pretty late, and around 1 AM, we decided to call it a night and get some sleep. We were sleeping in the same room, but our beds were on opposite walls. Around 3 AM, I was jolted awake by a faint rustling sound. I sat up in my bed, and when my eyes landed on Kapil, a chill shot down my spine. He was thrashing, desperately trying to move, but couldn't, and his eyes were wide open. I immediately knew it was sleep paralysis. Without thinking, I grabbed my water bottle and sprinkled a few drops on his face. It worked! He snapped out of it. But just as he did, we both heard it - the distinct sound of a plate dropping in the kitchen. We were both instantly terrified. Neither of us dared to go check it out. Then, to our horror, the same sound came again. We just stayed frozen in our beds, listening. After a few tense moments, we both started to relax a bit. I asked Kapil what had happened to him. He whispered that a ""totally black shadow"" had come and sat on his chest. He said he tried desperately to scream or even move his hands, but he couldn't. It was a truly terrible night for us. After that night, I never tried to sleep at his home again. Kapil later told me that he continued to experience such incidents. Now he's in the UK, so I don't talk to him as much about it, but that night is something I'll never forget.",The 3 A.m.

78,Haunted Places,"I was sleeping in my bedroom on my back, and the room was bright white. I could only see the blanket that was on top of me, which was a pink comforter with white outlines of flowers on it. There was a slight black outline of a figure standing at the end of my bed. He asked me a question, "" Do you want your family to die?"" My eyes were wide and I was struggling to breathe. But I couldn't get myself to move or say anything. He gave me 7 seconds to answer, and then he would choose for me. I screamed at myself to get up and tell him, "" No! I don't want them to die! Don't!"" But I still could not move. The seconds ticked by, until he was at the door, turning the doorknob, at 6. Right before he opened the door, I leapt up in bed and shrieked, "" No!"" and it ended. What was even more startling, was that I could hear my siblings outside my door, running around, screaming with delight. I was more scared than I had ever been in my whole life. I was so afraid. I think this was a sleep paralysis episode, but I've never had it confirmed, so I'm not sure. It's hard to describe how scared I was, terrified, panicked, petrified. I've never had another episode like this, but I've had dreams. During this episode, I had been having nightmares for months. I would see dead girls, dead family, or something would just be... Off. I was never sure what it was though. And none of my dreams were happy. There might not have been any danger on the surface, but it was there. The clouds were covering the skies, the sun was never out, or it would be raining.

79,Haunted Places,"This is my second story here This happened to me in 2016 when my company sent me for a training to Chennai. I was based out of Bangalore that time. The company had booked a room for me in newly opened hotel belonging to the noted international chain of hotels. It was situated on OMR road. This was my first company sponsored trip/training. Right from bus ticket booking, accommodations, training fees and taxi charges was bore by company, I was enjoying every day there. As the hotel was part of famous chain of 5 star hotels, the ambience was world class. The hotel was opened in the same month I had the booking and they threw a lavish party for its opening while I was staying there. Coming to my room, I didn't find anything unusual or negative vibe when I entered it first time. Room was comfortable and interior was nice. I was quite enjoying the room especially the bed was so soft and comfortable. The incident happened one weekend. As it was weekend and no training, I went for a nap after having my breakfast. I like to put blanked all over my body while sleeping, even if it's day time nap. So my body was fully covered in blanked. After an hour or so I was woke up and wanted to remove blanked but I was not able to do so. I tried again but still I couldn't. Now I started freaking out as I felt some force is trying to hold my blanket and is not letting me come out. I was completely awake and in my senses, I made myself sure that I am not dreaming and then I gave a try again but still no use. After trying multiple times and with applying all the force I have I gave up. I was not even able to make any sound. My whole body was frozen/paralyzed. Now I realized this is what called as paranormal and I started praying to God. I kept begging God to help me out and let me come of it. This is first experience of this kind in my life hence I was not getting any clue of what energy or force or entity it is. It was not making any sense or logic to me. But I had complete faith in God and I am doing Puja since childhood and due to which eventually I was able to come out of the blanket. And everything was back to normal. And that whole paranormal incident felt like seconds and past away from me like storm past me and I am safe from danger. After this incidence nothing of that sort happened and stayed peacefully in that room for few more days and travelled to Bangalore after finishing the training. I haven't shared this experience with anyone fearing of getting trolled until now. And I am not sure what had happened that day.

80,Haunted Places,"I've come across numerous posts here about sleep paralysis, so I thought I'd share my own experience. My journey with sleep paralysis began shortly after I started working in 2008. Since the early days of my career, I've worked a variety of shifts - sometimes early mornings, other times late nights - and I believe that inconsistency in my sleep schedule may have contributed to my experiences. It wasn't long before I began facing bouts of sleep paralysis. The first two or three times it happened, I was absolutely terrified. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, unable to move, feeling a wave of panic wash over me as I struggled to regain control of my body. At first, I didn't know what was happening. My mind raced with fear, and although I never saw any shadowy figures or sinister entities like many others have reported, the feeling of being trapped in my own body was scary enough. After those initial episodes, I gradually came to understand what was happening and learned to stay calm during these occurrences. The fear faded with time, and I managed to adapt, even if I couldn't fully prevent the episodes. Interestingly, when I eventually moved away from shift work and established a more regular sleep schedule, the sleep paralysis stopped entirely. For several years, I didn't experience a single episode. But recently, due to my own negligence and disruptions in my sleep routine, it made an unwelcome return. I know now that it's directly linked to how well I manage my sleep patterns. The reason I'm sharing my story is that I've noticed many people associate sleep paralysis with supernatural forces or evil entities. But in my experience, it's much more about how we take care of our sleep. I've never seen any entities or creatures during these episodes, which makes me believe this phenomenon has more to do with poor sleep hygiene and stress rather than something paranormal. While this isn't meant to be a horror story, I do remember some intense nightmares during those periods. If anyone's curious, I can recall a few in vivid detail, but that's not really the point here. What I really want to emphasize is that many of the stories I've read lately about sleep paralysis focus heavily on the fear factor, portraying it as a deeply frightening experience connected to dark forces. In my opinion, it doesn't have to be that way. In fact, I've learned that with better sleep habits, sleep paralysis can often be avoided altogether. It took me some time to figure this out, but once I made the connection between my sleep routine and the episodes, I took control of the situation. For anyone going through something similar, I'd recommend paying close attention to your sleep patterns. A consistent, healthy sleep schedule made a world of difference for me, and I'm confident it can help others too. Sleep paralysis may feel overwhelming in the moment, but with the right approach, it doesn't have to dominate your nights.",Breaking The Chains Of Sleep Paralysis: My Journey,India,Haunted places,2024-09-25,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28437
81,Haunted Places,"I have had many different types of ""visitations"" from my point of view. From dark figures in my bedroom doorway that I couldn't really see no matter how hard I tried, to being picked up off my bed by an unseen person/entity, having someone or something grab my ankles while in bed and try to pull me off, to something sitting on my chest while I could not move or open my eyes and growl and snarl right into my face. Being able to feel the heat of its breath on my face. The worst time was when I believe myself to be awake. I was in bed, it was dark, no lights on. My bedroom door opened and I could see a dark shadow. Darker than the area around it, crawling around on the floor. I heard it coming around the bottom of the bed. I could hear it breathing, growling. I was laying on my side at the time facing the door. I felt the bed depress as it climbed up on the bed. I could not move. At this point I was on my side, unable to move and I could feel it on the bed where my back was. I felt it start to press against my back like to was trying to enter me. I was so terrified at that point I passed out from fear. I thought for sure I was going to die. A lot of this happened in my mid to late twenties to early thirties. It got so bad I refused to sleep in my room or go in there at all. This mostly happened after my parents purchased the empty lot next to us and were doing construction for a garage. But after I moved, it continued to happen at the new place. I was desperate for answers and reached out to a local paranormal group and informed them of my experiences. They told me that it sounded like Hypnagogic Hallucinations. Rather than continue to be terrified in my own home, I chose to see this as the answer. However, the terror of that night has never left me.

82,Haunted Places,"This happened to me when I used to live in Varanasi. As I had mentioned in my previous posts I live with my husband and son. My husband is in a transferable job so every 2-5 years we shift to a new city. We came to Varanasi in 2017 and were living in a government allotted bungalow. Everything was fine with that house. I never felt anything scary even when I was alone in the house with my son for 2-3 days when my husband was out on a tour. It all started in 2021. Some incidences occurred which I will discuss one by one. The post is going to be long so kindly be patient. At the end of 2020, my MIL got brain stroke and half of her body was paralyzed for months before she succumbed in 2021 Feb after suffering a lot. In March, my son who was completely healthy otherwise, woke up from sleep and was sitting on bed in the morning when suddenly he fell on the mattress with facial paralysis kind of condition on one side of the face (resembling my MIL's condition but only the face). He had urinated on bed (he was 11 years old then and had never wet his bed after he was like 2 years old) and tears were rolling down his face. This condition lasted for maybe 20-25 seconds and he was ok afterwards. Nevertheless we took him to the hospital where they admitted him for observation purpose. They conducted blood tests, EEG, MRI and everything came normal. He was discharged later. Later we took him to Kaal Bhairav Mandir for Puja. He is completely ok now and this wasn't repeated. Same year in August, my FIL, my SIL and her two daughters came to visit us. Let's call her elder daughter X and younger Y. X was 2 years and Y 11 months old. X was diagnosed borderline autistic and the main purpose of their visit was her treatment. X used to be engrossed in herself not making eye contact with anyone and not responding to anyone except rarely to her mother. It was also difficult to make X sleep and on certain nights she would look at different corners of the room and would laugh and smile as if playing with someone. My SIL felt uneasy to sleep alone so me and my son also slept in the same room (my husband was transferred and had joined duty in another city). One night, X started looking at the walls again, laughing and all. My SIL held her tight inside her lap not allowing her to look there. But no matter how many times she tried, X would somehow manage to free herself and start doing the same thing. I ran out of my patience and started playing Hanuman Chalisa (prayer to hindu god Hanumanji which is renowned to scare away ghosts) on my phone. This calmed her a bit but then she went back to do the same thing. Then I remembered that I had holy water and oil from a priest. I brought it from another room and put it on X's forehead. X seemed amazed for a few seconds but this calmed her down. Now she was sitting in her mother's lap, calm. I sprinkled the water and oil in the room, and also put it on the forehead of everyone in the room. While I was leaving the room to put the holy water and oil back to its place I looked back to see X looking at me in my eyes eerily. When I came back I saw my SIL had laid X on the bed beside her. My son and Y were both asleep. It was around 4AM. I lied down next to X. My SIL was on one side of the bed, and me on the other side with X between us. I saw X who was calm but still looking at me. I felt a bit uneasy as she never used to make eye contact with anyone. Now I changed my position with my back towards her and turned off the light (night light was still on). I felt tired and was about to sleep when I experienced typical sleep paralysis symptoms. I was not able to move, speak. It felt like somebody had grabbed me from back side. I was trying to call for help but all I could say was- uhh uhh. I was really terrified, it didn't came to my mind that I should recite Hanuman chalisa or some other holy name, I don't know why. After sometime, my SIL called, "" Bhabhi what happened?"" And immediately I was ok. I put on the light and told her what happened, she told me that she was also listening to the sounds I made but was too afraid to call me. But when I continued doing so she gathered courage and called me. X was still awake but calm looking at us. I was so afraid that I couldn't sleep at all. My SIL and X slept after a while. I was shocked and terrified. I told this to my FIL when he woke up who didn't believe any supernatural angle to this incident and just laughed at us. From the next day, we slept with lights on. But from then onwards my life changed. I started having scary nightmares. I was afraid of sleeping in the dark, whenever I switched off the light while sleeping I would feel somebody grabbing me from behind. I had similar dreams too. My SIL and FIL returned to their native place 2 months later and we shifted to a new city. Although the city, home everything changed, my life has continued to be miserable- I lost my father, I and my son continued getting nightmares, I had fights with almost everyone close to me without any serious reason, even some of them casually stopped talking to me without any reason. I started feeling sad and lonely all the time although I am a loner and enjoy being alone. I and my husband had taken some advices and did remedial measures. They work but as soon as we stop doing it, my situation becomes the same although my son is better now. I am sorry to say this but I sometimes feel that could it be my MIL affecting my life as I had a love-hate relationship with her or is there a possibility that she herself was attacked by some spirit which is affecting every family member since her death? Just before she had the stroke, she had purchased a land in her name which is said to be cursed and affects the owner of the land but my FIL and MIL didn't believe it. After my MILs death, I came to know later that my FIL had done some Puja secretly after getting the soil of that land checked by someone when he was in Varanasi but neither me nor my husband knows anything about it in detail and my FIL refuses to talk about it. I seriously need advice as to what should I do to get back my normal life. Although I'm better now, I can't keep on doing cleansing rituals throughout my life. What should I do to free myself of this situation forever?

83,Haunted Places,"I recently stumbled on this website and I'd like to get your take on an experience I had two years ago. First a little back ground. I'm a twenty-seven year old construction worker. I've never done drugs and at the time of the story I had and still have stopped drinking alcohol. I'm what my mother explained to me is called an empath; I can pick up on feelings, emotions, and even experience them myself no matter how I was feeling previously. Like getting angry due to someone nearby even if I had been happy moments before. I've had small paranormal experiences all my life. It ranges from whispers to feeling a presence and even seeing shadow figures. This is my first experience with what I assume folks call sleep paralysis but I'm unsure if that's what it would be classified as. One, day I came home from working a twelve hour shift. I had come back from working on an old house renovation. This home has been on the coast of Mississippi since about 1940 to 1950. While there the entire building felt heavy and almost depressing like someone turned on an energy vacuum and sucked it right out of you. When I got home from work I was so exhausted that I decided to get straight to bed. I laid in my room all electronics including the TV off and slept for a bit. I suddenly woke up do to a strange sensation, it was cold and I mean like cold fear gripping me. I tried to get up and look around but I couldn't move anything except my eyes. I tried forcing my body to move even mentally scream at it to move. I noticed the tv that was previously off before I fell asleep was now on. I thought that was strange the tv was on a blue screen. Then I noticed this for lack of a better term crimson mist slowly spread across the tv and out of the mist appeared a horned black silhouette. The silhouette seemed to be staring at me. When I saw it my blood ran cold. I began mentally freaking out ordering my body to move, but the most I could do is get my fingers to twitch slightly. As I lied there slowly losing it I felt a warmth suddenly envelope me and what felt like a hand on my back. Then I heard, ""Bojack, wake up."" The only person whoever called me that was my grand father but he'd been gone for over a decade when this occurred. I blinked and whatever spell or what have you I was under was gone - I could move again. I looked at the tv. It was still on but the mist and figure were both gone. This is my first time experiencing anything like this at all and I'd like your take on what happened to me that day.

84,Haunted Places,"Assalam o alaikum (may peace be upon you) Before starting the story let me excuse for any grammatical errors as English is not my native language. A little background: My family and I live in a house that belonged to my grandfather but before that it belonged to his grandfather so it's an old house but it was rebuilt by my father in the 90s and being so old there also have been some sudden deaths including children. As of now we are five family members and I'm the youngest of all. I have always been a firm believer in the paranormal due to some personal experiences of my childhood. The experience I'm going to share today happened in probably January or February 2022. Now the actual story, it was maybe 3am at night, I was sleeping when I had a sleep paralysis for the second time. I saw a tall black thing standing near my bed on the side of my feet, it was tall, thin and very very black and I don't know how but I knew it was a male. It had white holes where the eyes were supposed to be. I have a small blue bulb on in my room at night whose light is enough to make out every thing in the room but this thing was so dark that I couldn't see anything except for it's outline. I tried my best to free my self from the paralysis but it didn't help. Then I started reciting Ayat ul kursi (It's a Quranic dua) in my heart and then... I don't remember what happened next... I think I just blacked out because later when I woke up that thing was not anywhere in the room and all was normal and I felt that it was just a dream. I'm not sure if I saw it in real or dreamt about it but the fear was real and I had never seen a ghost before. In the morning, I told mama about it and she believed me but couldn't do anything. Sorry I forgot to mention one thing that while this thing was standing and looking at me there were different voices going on in my head. I don't remember the exact words but they told me that this thing meant harm to me (I didn't tell my mother about it). After a few days I completely forgot about it and I just shrugged it off and after that night I recite a set of prayers so that I won't be haunted at night and thankfully it has stopped. But the reason I'm sharing this experience is beacause a few days ago I read a story from somewhere else which was very similar to my experience and that was the time I remembered my experience and those voices that told me that the thing was going to hurt me. I just feel sickened when I think about it.I've not told it to anyone but I want your thoughts on it. Is it possible that this creature was not evil but something less threatening? I've been very disturbed but I wasn't sure if I should share it here but I couldn't resist. Thanks for bearing my poor vocabulary and reading my story. Every thing mentioned above happened in real and I didn't make anything up by myself. I know it was a bit long hope it didn't bore you. I would share further experiences if you want me to.

85,Haunted Places,"This happened to me last month when I had been to my hometown Goa, for a vacation. We have our own flat and this incident occurred there. On 10th Jan 2022, around 2:30 AM. The bedroom which I was sleeping in has 2 windows adjacent to each other. Suddenly I heard footsteps walking from one bedroom window to the next and then it would stop there. This happened a few times. Initially I thought it was the night watchman taking his rounds, but even if he was, was wondering why it would just start from one window and end until the next as the windows were not so far apart from each other. And I was afraid to go to the window and see if it was a watchman or not, because I thought if it wasn't, I didn't want to have a frightful image stuck in my mind. As this went on, there was a sudden fear that gripped me and that fear is something I just can't describe. I went on praying and calling out to Jesus and then started playing worship songs and eventually fell asleep. Then, around 5:45 - 6 AM, I felt as if someone or as if kids were jumping on the other side of my bed. There are no kids in the house. Again I got a bit afraid and started praying, when suddenly I felt as if someone was holding my legs and neck and I was not able to breath, talk, shout, nothing! I tried fighting back and turn to see what that was, and caught, what I felt, was a glimpse of a big black shadow at my feet. Tried again to scream and call out God's name, but it wasn't happening. At that time I felt even in my mind and spirit I was not able to say God help me. This struggle/fight went on for quite a while then as suddenly it started, it stopped and I was released. Frightened was not the word to describe what I felt then and though have come across weird happenings or seeing spirits etc. This was something I experienced for the first time in my life and hopefully the last. Could it have been sleep paralysis?

86,Haunted Places,"This will be my first submission to this site. I am a regular reader of Real Ghost Stories since very long time. This is a real incident which I experienced during March, 2019. My wife and I, along with a friend and his wife, planned a weekend getaway to a nearby beach. It was approximately 2 hour drive along the coast of Northern Maharashtra (a state/province in India). We started our journey in the morning and reached the destination just before noon. Since it was an ad-hoc plan, we didn't book a hotel to stay overnight. After reaching the place, we saw an old hotel just in front of the beach entrance. Since it was old, we first enquired about rooms in some newly built hotels nearby, but they were all booked for the weekend. Now, it was 1.00 in the afternoon and we were tired and hungry. So, we decided to enquire for rooms in that old Parsi hotel. To our luck, there were only 2 rooms available and we decided to take them instantly. We checked in and went to our respective rooms. The hotel was old Parsi house, converted to hotel. The hotel building was 0 + 2 floors and we got our rooms on the first floor. My room had a pool facing and it had a balcony with pool view. The window against the balcony faced a large mirror which was placed in the room, and in between was the bed. We settled down, freshened up and went out for lunch. After finishing lunch we directly went to the beach and spent time there until the place went dark (after sunset). We returned to the hotel and it was really dark. We already had our dinner at a restaurant nearby. We went to our rooms and crashed out. Just as I was lying down on the bed, I felt that some one was watching us. I checked the balcony and there was no one. I didn't realize when I dozed off. Suddenly, I woke up in the middle of the night with a feeling that someone is sitting on my chest. I was unable to move. I was facing the balcony and I saw that someone was there. It was a shadow figure with no clean distinct features. I tried to wake up my wife, but I couldn't move. I started murmuring holy verses (Hanuman Chalisa) in a hope to scare off ghost. Listening me murmur, my wife woke up. She switched on the lights, and saw me unable to move. She shook me and then I became free. I had no guts to get up and check the balcony for someone's presence. We decided to keep the lights on and sleep for the rest of the night. I was awake the whole night, while my wife was asleep. We freshened up and checked out in the morning. While my friend was busy doing some formalities at the hotel reception, I enquired about the hotel. It was really old building, built by the Parsis which moved to India from Persia due to persecution. This property belonged to someone who was among the initial settlers.",An Old Parsi Hotel,India,Haunted places,2022-02-17,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=27813
87,Haunted Places,"Before I relate my story, I would just like to say for the record how irritating it is to see so many infantile time wasters submitting stories that are clearly works of poorly written fiction. But here's my story. I can't say exactly when it happened, but it was in the neighbourhood of ten years ago. My wife and I were living in our apartment in Toronto, and I was having my third and I hope last of my sleep paralysis experiences. The previous two were quite close together and uneventful, maybe two months prior to the one I'm about to describe. I found myself awake in the middle of the night, unable to move anything but my eyes. A typical sleep paralysis experience for me and from what I've read. But this time there were two figures in the room, partially illuminated by the lights in the parking lot outside. Dark foggy shapes, indistinct on the one hand and on the other they appeared to be of average human size and anatomical proportions. I felt that they were male. One was over to my right, looking out the window to the parking lot below. The other one was to my left. I was on the left side of the bed, and he was quite close to me, close enough to touch, looking down at a book that I'd been reading on my drop-leaf bedside table. It was a copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover. I looked over as best I could, to my still sleeping wife, and said to her in my head ""They're friendly"". I have no idea how I would know that with such profound authority, but that's what I felt. And I didn't feel at all threatened by this otherwise alarming event unfolding in our bedroom. That's all I remember. I was apparently asleep immediately following my announcement to my wife, something that seems to be a common thread in sleep paralysis experiences. That part interests me a lot. I think it's unnatural to fall asleep directly after waking up in the middle of the night. Doesn't everybody toss and turn for a bit before falling asleep again? We no longer occupy the apartment in Toronto, but I periodically replay the experience in my mind, particularly when I pass by the drop-leaf table or pick up the copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover.",They're Friendly,Canada,Haunted places,2021-11-15,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=27739

I am falling to sleep and some bad dreams are playing in my mind, if I am sleeping on left hand side, I feel something or somebody is pressing me tightly, holding my arm, wrist or fingers, and saying like ""COME WITH ME"". I won't sleep until early morning until 4 am comes. I woke up sometimes see my mobile the time will be like 1am or 2 am. I am not sure if my mind is playing the trick or not. Is it Hallucination or illusion? Sometimes I feel like I am into sleep paralysis, or sometimes my hand will be automatically floating upwards as if someone or something is lifting up. I had this bad experience for the past two years. If I am unable to sleep I will turn on the music and will sleep. My family is very spiritual and they used to pray for my well being. But even though I am experiencing these kind of things some say it must be overthinking or imagination and if I say this things to my parents, they are not listening. So some say pray god and sleep.

89,Haunted Places,"This happened a long time ago in my teen years. You know. The years when you're daring and reckless! However, I was the one who 'knew' better during this particular incident. My two best friends-call them Dee and Val-wanted to have a slumber party. We had a previous one at Dee's house and had a lot of fun. This time it was to be at Val's house. We invited some of our other friends. Eight of us in total. We arrived at Val's house around six in the evening. Her mother ordered some pizzas and pop for all of us. We really enjoyed that. From there we went down to the basement where Val's parents fixed up the rec-room to accommodate all of us with mats and sleeping bags. While down there one of the girls told us about a trick of sorts that we could experiment with. One of you lies on the floor and the others gather around with one person at the head and feet. The person at the head leads it off with this is so and so. She is dead and everyone around them says the same thing. Then the lead person says she is light as a feather and stiff as a board and around to each person again. The last thing the lead says is she will rise and float like a feather. At that point we all have two fingers of both our hands under the person and we begin to lift in unison. Guess what? It 'worked'. Val was the one on a sleeping bag that we lifted. The floor was too dirty, so she laid on a sleeping bag. She actually 'did' float beyond our grasp and rise to the ceiling until her nose touched it. We were freaking and she opened her eyes and screamed. We all panicked and withdrew our hands shouting, ""catch her, catch her."" However, nobody was holding her, and she fell from ceiling height. Wham! Fortunately, she landed on the sleeping bag with no injuries other than just being shook up. We were very intrigued by this. Actually, we were mystified. About then Val and Dee-they are the main protagonists here-got the bright idea to have a Ouija board session. Val asked the girl that lived right next door to her to go home and fetch her board. Apparently, this girl had one. About this time, I gave them all a great, big ""Nope. Not me."" I told my friend, Dee about the session my sister and cousins had a couple years before and she was extremely intrigued by my account of what happened. I told her that I think they are dangerous and not a toy to be played with. They called me chicken. I told them ""That's right, I'm a chicken that knows 'better'"". I'm going home, but I 'am' warning you that you'll regret messing with that thing, and I bid them a good night. I gave my mom a lame duck excuse for coming home from the party. I told her that the pizza gave me an upset stomach. Unfortunately, I had to endure a spoonful of Pepto-Bismal. Yuck! I went to bed. The next day there was a knock on our side door. It was Dee looking very ashen and wide-eyed. She asked me to step outside so we could talk. While outside she looked at me serious as a heart attack and told me what happened after I left. She apologized for calling me 'chicken' and told me that ""I"" was absolutely 'right' about warning them not to mess with that thing. They were asking it stupid questions like who was going to marry whom and that kind of girl stuff, but then they asked questions they shouldn't have. They began receiving knocks in response to their questions. Right away Val thought it was her older brother, but he was in the living room with the rest of the family watching T.V. When she went upstairs to query him. They continued, even more intrigued than ever. However, they started getting unnerving answers and hearing strange noises. I am only going by what Dee told me. They got scared and quit the session. They all climbed into their sacks/mats. That is when things started that 'they' couldn't explain. Dee told me that it got incredibly cold down there and they heard more knocking. They, then, began to hear something shuffling around them in a steady gait, but they didn't 'see' anything. A couple of the girls yelped after being poked by unseen fingers. They were so scared that they began making a commotion that alarmed her mother to the point of running down to the basement to find out what was going on. When they told her mom what they did, she really read Val and the others the riot act. She told them that those things are not toys and she confirmed that they are dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. She told the girl that brought it to get it out of her house or she'd take a sledgehammer to it. The girl ran home and disposed of it. She was truly frightened. They didn't get much sleep that night. Dee told me that Val would be coming by, also, to apologize to me because I was right to caution them. Matter of fact, they 'all' apologized to me. Quite humbly I might add. I didn't hold it against them. It's a shame that they had to get so terrified to realize ""I"" was merely giving them good advice. I told them I was 'trying' to give 'them' the benefit of my experience and how it scared the crap out of me, my sister and cousins also. They listened to me a wee bit more after that. I became the knowledgeable sage to them where the paranormal was concerned. However, I am 'still' learning things to this day. I think we 'all' are. I never was tacky enough to say ""I told you so"" because I figured that they felt bad enough. Not to mention scared enough. Sometimes teenage girls can be as bad as teenage boys when it comes to doing things without considering the consequences. This occurrence could have been a lot worse, but I'm very glad that it wasn't for my friends' sake.

90,Haunted Places,"This happened many years ago when I was a dumb kid, & messed with something I shouldn't have only to regret it later. My cousins, C., & K. (Just using the initials for privacy reasons.) lived in Cleveland. My folks would take us to visit with them quite frequently through the years when we were growing up since C. Was my age, & K. Was my sister, J's age, which was 5 years younger. So, C., & I were the 'big sisters'. We were the big girls. About 13-14 years old around this time. It was during the Fall time of the year. We did all the stupid things that kids do before they develop something in the later years called 'common sense', lol! We told ghost stories a lot & recorded our antics on a little 3-inch reel-to-reel tape recorder that I had. We'd play ourselves back for fun. We'd go exploring, or walking to places that we thought were interesting. In other words, we had fun together. One time, whilst visiting at their house in Cleveland, one of us-I don't remember who-had the idea to conduct a 'seance'. Since I had had some paranormal experiences when I was much younger, I was selected to conduct it. Lucky me. I didn't really give too much credence to what we were about to do at the time. I wished later that I would have. They lived in a relatively smallish-sized house. There was the master bedroom downstairs that my aunt, & Uncle slept in, & a spare room that they used kind of like a playroom. It was small, but big enough to accommodate a sofa, T.V. Stand, easy chair, & 2 little end-tables. My cousin's bedroom was upstairs. It was originally the attic when they bought the house, but my aunt, & Uncle labored to turn it into a lovely girl's bedroom of a very large size with a walk-in closet/cubby-hole room on one side of the hallway. We held the seance in the back spare room. We closed the door, & just lit a small lamp to give off a soft light. Before starting we had to decide who we wanted to contact. The vote was to contact-get this-King Tut. I began it with a tongue-in-cheek attitude quite frankly. However, as it progressed, I began to take it seriously. We were all concentrating & calling on him while holding hands & staring at the lamplight. It wasn't but about 10 minutes into the session that we started to observe 'something' forming in the corner behind the easy chair that sat next to the window. It was rather short of stature, standing rather off-center, & a vaporous gas-fire blue. It looked like a short person. We sat speechless & transfixed just staring at it. We were squeezing each other's hands so hard I'm surprised that we didn't break each other's fingers. That's how stunned we were. Suddenly the spell was broken when ""I"" had what felt like 2 fingers forcefully rammed into my right ribcage causing me to jump, & scream at that point. We all unclasped hands & watched as the form just evaporated from the corner of the room. One of my cousins jumped up to the light switch & turned the lights on. Our parents came to the back room, & demanded to know what us kids were up to. The usual answer from a kid was 'nothing'. We were told to keep it down. We didn't dare tell our parents 'what' we were doing. Our parents were religious, & what we were doing was a major, big time no-no. We just all sat there looking at each other, & glancing around the room trying to evaluate just 'what' really happened to us. I was sitting on the far end sofa that had a stuffed toy kitty sitting on the armrest. So, who poked me so hard that it hurt. No one was even near me. I know what I felt. It actually hurt. Matter of fact, I had a little bruise between my ribs to prove it. I decided, then, & there, no more conducting seances. It was far too scary for my taste. However, 'that' was not the end of it. Months later. In the good ol' Summertime, our cousins came to visit us. We went upstairs to my sister's, & my bedroom. C., & K. Wanted to have another seance'. I protested, but they 'talked' me into it. Ugh! Our bedroom was, once, the attic also, but our parents worked hard to turn it into a beautiful bedroom for us. We all sat on the floor & lit a candle. We were discussing who we wanted to contact. One of my cousins mentioned Adolph Hitler. I gave a resounding ""no way!"". I told them to contact someone nice. Not a monster like that. We decided on Abe Lincoln. He was always my favorite President, next to JFK. We held hands, once again, & concentrated. This time I asked for an audible signal like 2 knocks. Inside of a couple minutes we heard 2 loud knocks resounding from our cubby-hole crawl space that we used for storage. We 'all' heard it. I lost my nerve at that point. I told it to go away, & I broke the circle. I told my cousins that what we were doing was not a good idea. That we shouldn't be messing with stuff like this. My cousins were intrigued, but my little sister, J., 'listened' to me. Unusual for a little sister to 'listen' to the big sister, but J. Looked up to me, & if ""I"" said it's a bad idea then it's a bad idea. However, that was not quite the end of it that night. Unbeknownst to me, the worst was yet to come. After they went home, we went to bed for the night. Nothing strange there. J., & I had twin beds. One on each side of the room across from each other. Next to our beds & built into the walls were shadow boxes that we kept little knickknacks, some ceramic animals, books, & we each had a little doll sitting in the cases. About 2 in the morning, I heard what I, first, thought was my Dad tromping up the steps to our room. He would, sometimes, come up to check on us. As parents often do. Only 'this' time he didn't turn on the hallway light coming up the steps. He would bring his flashlight with him to shine just far enough to make sure we were in bed, & alright. This time there was no hall light, or a flashlight. I thought that to be very strange for him. I was laying on my stomach, pretending to be asleep when I got the feeling that it wasn't my Dad coming to look in on us after all. I, then, heard very heavy footsteps on the tile floor coming towards us. My Dad was always barefooted when he did his checks. This whatever it was had heavy-soled shoes on. I, suddenly, felt enveloped in an intense cold. To the point of shivering. Weird! It was Summer. That upstairs bedroom was ridiculously hot that time of year, & in 1968 my Dad couldn't afford A/C at the time. So, we just slept with the windows open for air. I laid there motionless, & barely breathing with my eyes closed tight. I felt a definite weight leaning over me & heard the items in my shadowbox being moved around. After that I heard 'it' go over to my sister's bed & do the same thing. I was freaking. I, then, heard it turn, & walk away back down the steps. I must've passed out after all this was over. In the morning, my sister began accusing me of knocking all the stuff over in her shadowbox. However, everything was knocked over in my shadowbox as well. I told her exactly what happened during the night. Her face went blank. We were very frightened. We vowed to never conduct a seance' again. A couple of weeks later I confessed to my Mom what we had done. As expected, she read me the riot act. My Mom is deeply religious & told me that only God has the power to do those things! I felt quite upset, & ashamed. I would never do something disrespectful like that. At that time in my life, I didn't even give a thought to what we did. To us dumb kids, we thought it was cool, but cool soon turned on us, & brought us to our senses the hard way. I guess that some of the best lessons learned are those that we learn the hard way. I've, since that time, have never again experimented with conducting, or participating in seances. I realized that you cannot command the spirits to perform for our amusement. If anything, you respect them. I've had visitations from my late husband, but I never tried to contact him. He came to 'me' as an assurance that 'he' is alright & loves me. He has visited me in special circumstances when I was extremely stressed, & trepidatious to give me comfort. I believe that our loved ones do that to comfort & encourage us. That's fine with me, but I, no longer try to contact the other side. I know better. I learned my lesson. If you don't know what you're doing, just don't do it. You'll be better off in the long run. I hope these are words of wisdom!",Get Frightened-learn A Lesson,United States,Haunted places,2023-08-24,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=28146
91,Haunted Places,"When I was in my early teens I used to spend a few weeks each summer at my grandma's farmhouse out in the country. The house was very old, complete with a root cellar under the kitchen, and a rickety staircase. The front part of the house was bright and airy and happy, but the back part was gloomy and creepy. We mostly used the back for storage and rarely went there. The house didn't generally have bad vibes, but I felt like the happy front part of the house was besieged by darkness lingering in the back and in the creepy root cellar underneath. I was never one hundred percent comfortable there. One time my grandma was out grocery shopping or visiting a friend and I was left alone in the house. There weren't many kids my age in this tiny town and I mostly had to fend for myself for entertainment. TV reception was terrible (this was back in the 80s!), so I spent most of my time walking, reading and doing crafts. To break the monotony, I thought that it would be fun to experiment with an Ouija board. I didn't have one on hand, and since I was alone, I didn't think it would work anyway. Then I recalled that a friend once told me that instead of an Ouija, you could use a needle suspended over the alphabet drawn around a circle. The needle would supposedly move and point to letters in response to questions. It didn't sound very legit, but I was bored and decided to try it. I drew letters around a circle and suspended a needle on a thread over it. The needle settled pointing to the center of the circle (thank you, Gravity) and did not move again. But I wasn't going to give up that easily! I figured that if I rested the point of the needle in the center and tilted the needle a little by lowering its top, I could get the top to spin around while the tip remained anchored in the center, then the top was bound to settle pointing to a letter. This time I had the laws of physics on my side, so the needle did indeed point to different letters each time I gave it whirl. I'm sure I started with some silly questions about which boys liked me, and I'm sure I got some gibberish answers. It wasn't really working. I was ready to give up, but decided to ask what my profession will be when I grew up. The needle spelled the word ""shoe"". This freaked me out. I ran out of the house and sat out in the yard until grandma returned. Once back from summer break, I told my friends about what had happened. We had a good laugh about me becoming a shoe. Several years went by and I had forgotten about the incident entirely. It all came back though, when I found myself working in the SHOE department at a large store.",Quasi-ouija Prediction,United States,Haunted places,2022-03-27,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=27846
92,Haunted Places,"A few years ago, I think it was in around 7th or 8th grade, we went on a school trip to Bad Tölz, Germany. From the beginning on my best friend and I -who both tend to pick up on energies at lot more than most people- already felt something was just off about the place. But it really kind of escalated after we had a little ""séance"" in the forest, that belongs to the place we stayed at. We asked the basic questions like if there was any spirits near us, and at some point all of us started feeling like we were being touched, for example on my neck and ankle or my friend's arm. A few minutes later, we noticed that these exact spots had turned bright red. We actually had photos of that, but since it's been so long, we all have new phones by now. We did end the séance properly by the way, by all of us saying goodbye and thanked the spirit for talking to us. We had already kind of started to get a little scared at that point, but it just got worse. After it got dark my roommate and one of the people who had also taken part, were brushing their teeth when they suddenly saw glowing red eyes in the mirror. So obviously we were even more terrified after that, but it still didn't stop there. We decided to sleep in the same bed because of that. It was in the middle of summer so we opened the window a little. At around 23:30-00:00 o'clock, the window suddenly slammed all the way open. There was no wind. The window was so heavy and difficult to move that we had to open it together. After that, we noticed a shadow in a corner, where no shadow should have even been cast because it was on the opposite side to the window. We even tried to debunk this afterwards, but the only things tall enough in the room were the bunk beds and a closet, none of which could have thrown a shadow like that. Needless to say we were kind of traumatized after that night lol. I really don't know what happened that day and why that happened.",We Saw A Shadow Figure And Red Glowing Eyes,Germany,Haunted places,2022-03-02,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=27829
93,Haunted Places,"My home has an un-airconditioned basement that we use primarily for washing clothes, keeping the dogs, and storage. When it's not too hot or cold outside, I will go down there sometimes at night to do group chats with friends after my wife and kids have gone to sleep. One evening, while down there, an old Operation board game started making one of the noises over and over again. This was a version which had a funny sound for each of the organs to remove. It initially scared the crap out of me, but afterwards, I laughed about it and the guys on my group chat heard it and laughed too. It would do this randomly every so often for months at a time, using different sounds each time, over and over. I assumed that it was just the old board game slowly dying. My family all heard it as well. Later, we began finding evidence of a rodent in our basement. I caught glimpses of it out of the corner of my eye and assumed, because of its size, speed, and ability to climb rapidly, that it was a squirrel, as we'd had them in the attic. It did a good deal of hidden damage, especially chewing up books or other research material, and we began to find nests all over the garage. We tried various means to get rid of it, including a variety of traps, poison and a sound emitter. Nothing worked. We eventually saw the culprit, which turned out to be a very large rat, but we could never catch it. It was able to climb vertically as fast as a squirrel; much faster than a rat should have been able. It seemed to be abnormally intelligent, like, Rats of Nym, intelligent. It would get the bait from the traps without triggering them, and wouldn't eat the poison blocks. I put all the poison blocks in the rafters and ductwork to prevent the dogs from getting them. However, at some point, the rat pushed one of the blocks onto the floor, where one of our dogs found it, and we had to quickly take him to the veterinarian to induce vomiting and ensure he was okay. He made a full recovery. During this same time frame, when I opened the basement door and turned on the lights, I would notice a shadow in the shape of a person at the bottom of the stairs, just for an instant before vanishing. Not always, but sometimes. I could turn the lights off and on again and it would not reappear. I assumed it was some weird electrical issue. My daughter finally encountered the rat in the basement and killed it with her softball bat. I got rid of it and cleaned out the basement, and we thought that was the end of it. Only, another rat showed up in the next week or two and continued the damage and continued to elude death or capture. Eventually, I started to think outside the box, as I had never really put any of the three phenomena (he rats, the shadow, and the Operation noises) together, but realized they had all occurred during the same time frame. I noticed that my old Ouija board was directly beneath the Operation game. I had not used it since high school. I researched Ouija boards and discovered that you are supposed to close sessions by moving the pointer to goodbye, and not to store the pointer on the board. I had never done that, although the board had not been used in more than 20 years, and I had never had any real encounters with it; just pushed it around to scare the other teenagers. That evening, when I went home, I took it down and opened the box, and sure enough, I had left the pointer on the board, which I reckon left the connection open for all those years, until something found it and used it. I quickly moved the pointer to Goodbye, asking any presence to leave and not return, and saying a prayer. I then stored the pointer in the box, separated from the board. A few days later, we found the dying rat in a drawer, poisoned, and after cleaning the basement out again, have had no further rodent problems. The shadow stopped appearing at the bottom of the basement stairs as well, and the Operation game stopped making noises. I don't have any concrete evidence, or any real answers, but at this point, my hypothesis is that something found its way through the open Ouija board and somehow managed to manipulate the board game, the rats, and manifest as the shadow at the bottom of the stairs. Our home has been saged, and I grow sage in our basement as well, now. I have also done enough research to be able to respond if anything happens again.",Something In The Basement,United States,Haunted places,2022-02-22,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=27820
94,Haunted Places,"When I was about 10 years old, my mother and a next-door neighbor named Margaret Lowery, in Palo Alto (alleged to be a medium) were on the Ouija together one night. We'd often go over to our neighbor Margaret's house to do this, and my older brother would also attend, and several of his friends as well. Most evenings, we'd have a regular spirit contact that the participants would reach named just ""Kim"", who had all sorts of interesting things to say. On this particular evening, a different contact came through, instead of our usual contact named ""Kim"", and spelled out its name as simply ""John"". Nothing else. Just ""John"". After a pause, a remaining message came through, and was in retrospect rather chilling, for at the time we didn't know what ""John"" meant when He said these two words...""Warn Bobby"". We didn't know anyone in our immediate family named ""Bobby"", so we were rather puzzled by this ""John"" contact, and what it had to convey to us all. It would become very clear that this ""Bobby"" that ""John"" was referring to was not a personal contact for us at all, but one personal to himself, and was also well-known to the entire United States, if not the entire world. For about a week later, we'd learned that a man called Sirhan Sirhan had assassinated Bobby Kennedy. We were stunned, however not immediately, at the time of the contact from ""John"", for at the time it had no particular meaning for any of us attending that Ouija session, but when the news came out of Robert Kennedy's assassination, we were left with a sinking feeling, for how could we have told anyone to ""Warn Bobby"", even if we had known who ""Bobby"" was at the time? With so many ""Johns"" and ""Bobby's"" in the world, were we contacted by John F. Kennedy, warning us of his younger brother's imminent demise? We will never know for certain, but will always wonder.

95,Haunted Places,"About 10 years ago, I experimented with a home made Ouija board with my friends. This was the start of my paranormal activity fascination. (I'll tell you that I don't remember much of this story but thank god this was the time I actually wrote down my experiences, besides school experiences). In the summer of 2011 (July 19 I think, all the notebook said was July). My friend Maddie invited me and my other friend Faith over for a sleepover. It was late at night somewhere around 9:30pm. We were all bored. We had watched about half of the movies Maddie owned (which was a lot) and it was only after 9pm. We had started watching movies at around 5pm so it was about 4 movies we had watched that night. After a while of chatting and eating snacks Maddie's parents brought us earlier, the topic of ghosts came up. I was interested in paranormal activity at the time (I still am) along with Maddie, who found it fascinating as well. Not much of a surprise that sneaked in the conversation. Faith was a different story. She actually had phasmophobia (fear of ghosts). Me and Maddie never got bothered by this and sometimes would try to help her overcome her fear. Anyway as we were talking about ghosts and stuff. Maddie suggested that we should play the Ouija board. Since I was an dumb and careless child I agreed with her. The only problem here was that Maddie didn't own a Ouija board and didn't know anyone else who would have an Ouija board. Faith sitting on Maddie's bed said we could make one. I could tell she wanted in on the action too. We agreed with Faith and went straight to work. Maddie didn't have any good supplies we could use so we had to make it out of construction paper. Faith helped and did all the drawing since she was good at it, I was searching up the rules, and Maddie was making the planchette. After everything was set up it was around 10 maybe 11pm. So it was dark out. Kind of a perfect time to play. So we set the board in between us (Me and Faith were up against Maddie's bed and Maddie was by her dresser). I learned that if you do it in figure eights that'll get the energy going. I tried it out by doing this moment 5 times with all of our fingers on the planchette. After the 5 time I asked if there's someone who would like to talk to us? The planchette moved over to yes. Me and the girls all looked at each other. We're now communicating a sprit? The energy in the room felt no different though. We just went a head asking questions, Faith staying close by be because she was freaked out. Maddie: ""Are you a good sprit?"" Answer: ""YES"" Faith: ""what's your name?"" Answer: ""Sadie"" Me: ""Sadie how old are you?"" Sadie: ""7"" Maddie: ""I don't mean to be mean but when did you die?"" Sadie: ""1998"" Faith: ""Where are you in the room?"" Sadie: ""She has Blonde hair"" Maddie: ""you mean me?"" Sadie: ""YES"" We all looked at each other then Maddie said she felt a strong peaceful like energy right on her left. I just went a head and asked a question. Me: ""Sadie, do you mind knocking some thing over for us?"" Sadie: ""YES"" A couple minutes later we saw one of Maddie's stuff animals fall off the shelf. Then there was laughter of a little girl. Seconds later the planchette moved again: Sadie:"" that was funny but I must leave "" Faith: ""I wish you could talk more"" All three of us said goodbye and then I moved the planchette to goodbye. It was a really interesting night for us and I'll never forget about it. Till this day Maddie hasn't experienced anything odd in her house which made us sad because the girl was so nice.

96,Haunted Places,"It was nearly 5 or 6 years since this incident had occurred in SK Pajar Sejingkat. I was in my senior years when this had happened. During this period, there was a spike of haunted game becoming famous among the kids of my school. Games like the Charlie Charlie Pencil, Bloody Mary, the Ouija board and many more that I don't remember. Now, the incident took place somewhere in a week close to the holidays. I was at the school surau with my class reciting the Quran, talking to each other, playing catch and all of that. It was normal then. But there were rumours of people playing haunted board games among the students in the surau. As we went on with our day, we were surprised by a sudden shriek coming from one of the school buildings, presumably the 5th or 4th year classes. At first we thought it was something like somebody accidentally breaking the windows again which actually was frequent in this school. But the person didn't stop screaming. The scream was so loud, I thought it came from the building we were in. Without hesitation, the boys in my class ran straight to where the noise was coming from. We can see from above that there's a classroom with students facing chaos in it. If I recall correctly, I saw a student being violent with other students while some tried to hold them down. The chaos continued to erupt while some of us were told not to go down with the ones that had already gone downstairs. The noise began to slow overtime and the boys are back. My friend who was with the group told us that the kids in the class are playing one of the known haunted board games. Now, I'm not sure exactly what the game was. I believed it was the Ouija board but my friend mentioned something about one of the students cutting their finger to drop a single droplet of blood on a certain coin. The events occurred again and again until eventually, the ustaz and ustazah of the school made a conclusion the events especially the first incident came from the games we were playing. This caused the school faculty to arrange a special assembly just to warn us about these games. We haven't played these games ever since.",The Board Game Incident At Primary School,Malaysia,Haunted places,2021-09-15,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=27694
97,Haunted Places,"So, I have been making DIY Ouija boards for the past few years, to see if they do work and what would happen pretty much. A recent experience I had was a spirit that was passing by and I was trying to see if I could get them to talk through the ouija board I had brought recently and the spirit instantly moved the planchette to goodbye, so I took that as a ""leave me alone please"" and I stopped for the night, but then as I was getting ready for bed the light in the bathroom flickered which it never has done before. Last night I tried to use it again and my grandma came through, which was kind of funny because we have always been close even after she died and because I've been really stressful recently. I've forgotten to talk to her and so the first thing she says to me is ""You're being rude for not talking to me in such a long time"". Which I knew was a joke, I also knew it was her because she knew answers to questions only she, me and my family would know, and I know to her me talking to her and still remembering her is something she's really grateful for because not all of our family does remember her. This story is just to let people know there are positive Ouija board stories out there, I've never talked to a demon or threatening entity, it's usually just normal spirits that want to be acknowledged and talked to (some spirits can pretend to be demons though) I've had one get so excited before because no one had talked to them in over 100+ years since their death.",Experimenting With Ouija Boards,United Kingdom,Haunted places,2021-07-27,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=27658
98,Haunted Places,"I am a fifteen year old female who moved into a new house a year ago. I used an Ouija board to communicate with a ghost. Her name is Carol and she died when she was ten years old. She wants me to find her body. I asked her how she died and she said buried alive. I asked her why she was here and she said she wants revenge. I asked how I could help and she said ""find my body"". There is a spot in my yard the size of a ten year old that is in between three trees placed into a perfect triangle. I want to help her but I am afraid that I'll find something. I also dabble in a little witchcraft, but I just call myself an earth witch. I just deal with plants not any witchcraft, black magic as some people call it. Should I help the spirit? I want to because she's going to be stuck here until she gets revenge but I don't want to find a dead body in my backyard. My mom is extremely religious and I don't want to tell her because she will be like ""you're lying bla bla bla"". I want to help her because no one should ever have to go through that. I find her presence calming like a friend when I collect plants. I think I should help her but I don't know. I'm afraid that if I do find something my mom will loose the house because it's part of a murder scene. Should I find someone with a scanner to see if something is there? I feel like she's at that spot but I don't know for sure. The house is a hundred years old and has belonged to several different owners some of them are dead.

99,Haunted Places,"Hey everyone. I would like to state that after reading other posts from folks on this site that I will NEVER AGAIN try to use a Ouija board ever again. I'm still curious about them but, as goofy as I can be, I won't push my luck on them:) My girlfriend (now wife) started college back in 2001. She dormed with her sister for a year. Her 2 best friends also ended up going to the same college so we would hang out a lot after her classes were over. Me, having been kicked out of school for terrible grades, would spend all my free time up there when I wasn't working. Her dorm building had a commons area on the 2nd and 3rd floor, and each area had various board games. Her floor just happened to have a Ouija board as well. We, showing all the grace and intelligence of 18 & 19 year olds, decided to break it out and use it. I was excited as I had never used one before, but my girlfriend had. Now before the fun part, it's worth pointing out that this was a Catholic college and her dorm building also served as a Catholic high school. Nuns still live on site and there is also a small cemetery next to the dorm where a few nuns were laid to rest. I don't remember who started asking questions, but we eventually got a response from someone claiming to be a nun. I can't remember this sister's name to save my life, forgive me as it's been almost 20 years. We started asking her questions, who she was, how she passed (the pointer started swinging back and forth for that question which really freaked us out), and if she was mad about something. Well it turns out that she was mad that I was there. We asked why she was mad and she spelled out my first name. This really freaked out my girlfriend. We then asked if she wanted me to leave and she replied with Yes. My girlfriend hugged me almost in tears so we ended the session and I soon after left the campus. Now there are various ways one can take essentially being chased out by a ghost from a college dorm. I myself find the best possible solution is to drive back to your home town (45 minutes for me at that time), go to the local ice cream hot spot (Magic Fountain in Elizabeth) and then order/devour a banana split all by yourself. Maybe this story is more about how I got ice cream instead of the Ouija board, but I still won't touch one ever again. Unless ice cream is guaranteed at the end. Side note - my girlfriend now wife just celebrated 13 years of wonderful marriage together, so take that Nun who chased me away!:D",The Nun Chased Me Away,United States,Haunted places,2020-09-01,https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=27385
